    "BDIvo_0007_0020": "You can say that again! I can't wait to\r\nsee what you'll whip up when we get\r\nback, master smith!",
    "BDIvo_0008_0000": "Hey Kirito, be sure you snag whatever\r\nrare materials you can find!",
    "BDIvo_0008_0010": "Sure, if I see any!",
    "BDIvo_0008_0020": "You'd better! Who knows, I might be\r\nable to make my best work yet!",
    "BDIvo_0009_0000": "Silica! Pina! How's it going?",
    "BDIvo_0009_0010": "Super charged and ready to go!\r\nPina just ate a whole bag of nuts!",
    "BDIvo_0009_0020": "Ha ha, no wonder she's amped up! Well,\r\ntime to fight like you earned them!",
    "BDIvo_0010_0000": "Kirito! Pina and I are gonna show you\r\nsomething special we've been whipping\r\nup!",
    "BDIvo_0010_0010": "Can't wait!\r\nLet's see how much you've improved!",
    "BDIvo_0010_0020": "Oh! But, uh... Please bail us out\r\nif we get in a pickle, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0011_0000": "Great to be fighting side-by-side with\r\nthe Absolute Sword, Yuuki again!",
    "BDIvo_0011_0010": "Kirito, I'll be giving it my all again!\r\nJust you watch!",
    "BDIvo_0011_0020": "Ha ha, sounds good!\r\nShow me what you've got!",
    "BDIvo_0012_0000": "Hey! Hey, Kirito! They used to call you\r\nthe Black Swordsman, right?",
    "BDIvo_0012_0010": "Ugh! Who told you about that?",
    "BDIvo_0012_0020": "Hehe! I have my sources. Now show\r\nme if you live up to the title!",
    "BDIvo_0013_0000": "Hey there, Info Broker.\r\nWhat's your take on all this?",
    "BDIvo_0013_0010": "Oh Kii-boy, ya really should know by\r\nnow that my intel doesn't come for free.",
    "BDIvo_0013_0020": "S-Seriously? You're taking \"a penny\r\nfor your thoughts\" too literally!",
    "BDIvo_0014_0000": "Heya, Kii-boy. Know what time it is?\r\nTime ta give me some support again!",
    "BDIvo_0014_0010": "Fine by me, but don't get dragged into\r\nanother mess just for one nugget of\r\nintel, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0014_0020": "Ha ha! Don't worry! I'll drag you down\r\nwith me and be just fine!",
    "BDIvo_0014_0030": "Don't. Seriously.",
    "BDIvo_0015_0000": "Klein! You ready to go?",
    "BDIvo_0015_0010": "Hell yeah I am, Kiridude!\r\nI feel ready for anything!",
    "BDIvo_0015_0020": "That's the spirit!\r\nI knew I could count on you!",
    "BDIvo_0016_0000": "Hey, Kiridude! You know who's\r\ngonna be today's MVP? This guy!",
    "BDIvo_0016_0010": "Just don't get carried away and hurt\r\nyourself, Klein.",
    "BDIvo_0016_0020": "I'm a grown man, not a kid!\r\nWhatever, just sit back and watch.\r\nI'll show you how it's done!",
    "BDIvo_0017_0000": "I'm really craving a ginger ale\r\nat your bar right about now, Agil.",
    "BDIvo_0017_0010": "Heh, then how about you come on down\r\nfor a party once we're done cleaning\r\nhouse?",
    "BDIvo_0017_0020": "Sounds great!\r\nLet's get a move on then!",
    "BDIvo_0018_0000": "Hey Kirito, don't overdo it out there,\r\nyou got it? You're always giving me\r\nheart attacks.",
    "BDIvo_0018_0010": "Huh? You're worried about me?\r\nI always knew you had a kind heart!",
    "BDIvo_0018_0020": "I-Idiot! Of course, I do! What kind\r\nof friend would I be if I didn't!\r\nSheesh...",
    "BDIvo_0019_0000": "You're fast as a rabbit, LLENN.\r\nYou better not leave me behind!",
    "BDIvo_0019_0010": "Got it! Oh, but go on ahead of me\r\nif we get separated, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0019_0020": "Uh, pretty sure that won't happen\r\nconsidering all the effort it takes\r\njust to keep up with you.",
    "BDIvo_0020_0000": "You play GGO too, right, Kirito?\r\nMaybe we'll bump into each other\r\nthere someday!",
    "BDIvo_0020_0010": "Sounds great. Oh, but who's to say\r\nwe'll be on the same side if we do?",
    "BDIvo_0020_0020": "Too true! You should know\r\nI'm not gonna go easy on you\r\nif we find ourselves on opposite sides!",
    "BDIvo_0021_0000": "Pretty intimidating guns you've got\r\nthere. They're not as mean as they\r\nlook, are they?",
    "BDIvo_0021_0010": "Heh, don't you mean you think my\r\nRightony and Leftania are the cutest?",
    "BDIvo_0021_0020": "Well, I guess they could be cute...\r\nIt depends how you look at them.",
    "BDIvo_0022_0000": "I'm gonna turn this place into a sea of\r\nfire with my grenades! Wait, what's\r\nthis? You're already charred black!",
    "BDIvo_0022_0010": "I just like this outfit, that's all.",
    "BDIvo_0022_0020": "Oops, my bad! So I guess I\r\ndidn't shoot you after all!\r\nHooray, I'm not crazy!",
    "BDIvo_0023_0000": "Kirito, never let your guard down\r\non the battlefield.",
    "BDIvo_0023_0010": "I know, I know.",
    "BDIvo_0023_0020": "Anyway, I feel like we could take\r\ndown any beast in the world together.",
    "BDIvo_0023_0030": "Together? G-Good grief.\r\nAnd I just got done telling you not\r\nto drop your guard, too.",
    "BDIvo_0023_0040": "Ow! Hey, what was that fo—\r\nUh, why's your face so red?",
    "BDIvo_0024_0000": "I have high hopes for you, Kirito.",
    "BDIvo_0024_0010": "And I'll live up to them all!\r\nWith style!",
    "BDIvo_0024_0020": "Keep a cool head!\r\nDon't get cocky!",
    "BDIvo_0025_0000": "Hey, Eugeo! Let's show them\r\njust what we're made of!",
    "BDIvo_0025_0010": "I'm with you there, Kirito.\r\nBut don't feel like you have to\r\ncover for me or anything, all right?",
    "BDIvo_0025_0020": "No problem, partner! Though I might\r\nturn to you if I'm in trouble!",
    "BDIvo_0026_0000": "Doesn't look like we're in for\r\nan easy fight, Kirito!",
    "BDIvo_0026_0010": "Don't worry, Eugeo. You're about to\r\nwitness the Aincrad Style firsthand!",
    "BDIvo_0026_0020": "I knew I could count on you.\r\nGive me a demonstration!",
    "BDIvo_0027_0000": "So the commander himself's taken the\r\nfield, huh? I'll be counting on you.",
    "BDIvo_0027_0010": "I'll do my best. But keep in mind\r\nthings rarely ever go exactly as\r\nplanned.",
    "BDIvo_0027_0020": "Yeah, but I'm not going to just sit\r\nback and let you handle everything.\r\nI'll earn my keep out there too!",
    "BDIvo_0028_0000": "I have high hopes for your potential,\r\nBlack Swordsman.",
    "BDIvo_0028_0010": "I simply do what I can,\r\nregardless of what the outcome may be.",
    "BDIvo_0028_0020": "Please, don't be modest. I know you\r\nwill always be reliable.",
    "BDIvo_0029_0000": "Looks like we're on the same team this\r\ntime, Death Gun. I can count on you not\r\nto stab me in the back, right?",
    "BDIvo_0029_0010": "I play by my own rules.\r\nBetter look out for stray bullets.",
    "BDIvo_0029_0020": "Hey, hey! You're joking, right?",
    "BDIvo_0030_0000": "Let us settle our score,\r\nBlack Swordsman.",
    "BDIvo_0030_0010": "Whoa, hold on, what do you say we take\r\ncare of the enemies in front of us\r\nfirst?",
    "BDIvo_0030_0020": "Tch! You live another day.\r\nBut your time will come.",
    "BDIvo_0031_0000": "Feels like today's gonna be a great\r\nday! And it's all thanks to your\r\nsinging, Yuna!",
    "BDIvo_0031_0010": "That's great! It's wonderful to know\r\nI can make a difference,\r\nno matter how small.",
    "BDIvo_0031_0020": "Don't sell yourself short. You're gonna\r\nbe a ton of help today. I know it!",
    "BDIvo_0032_0000": "Call on me when you need a hand,\r\nKirito!",
    "BDIvo_0032_0010": "U-Uh, thanks, but, um, I'd feel bad for\r\na certain someone if the two of us got\r\ntoo buddy-buddy.",
    "BDIvo_0032_0020": "Who do you mean?\r\nAnd why do you keep looking around?",
    "BDIvo_0033_0000": "Hey there, Eiji. You don't need those\r\nsynthetic muscles anymore, do you?",
    "BDIvo_0033_0010": "Hmph. I can fight just fine without\r\nthose now.",
    "BDIvo_0033_0020": "Awesome, that's good to hear!\r\nI'll need your help today!",
    "BDIvo_0034_0000": "I see you still haven't lost that\r\ngood nature of yours.",
    "BDIvo_0034_0010": "If I had, we wouldn't be fighting\r\nside-by-side right now, would we?",
    "BDIvo_0034_0020": "Hmph. Whatever.",
    "BDIvo_0035_0000": "I seriously can't believe I'm teamed up\r\nwith you, Sugou.",
    "BDIvo_0035_0010": "Believe me, the feeling is mutual.\r\nWhy must the exalted King of Fairies\r\nbe saddled with a brat like you?",
    "BDIvo_0035_0020": "Well look, complaining won't change\r\nanything, so let's just go!",
    "BDIvo_0036_0000": "Oh? You're volunteering to play herald\r\nfor your king? My thanks.",
    "BDIvo_0036_0010": "Are you kidding me? I'm taking out\r\nthese enemies. That's all.",
    "BDIvo_0036_0020": "Seriously, it really must be nice to\r\nlive in your delusions 24/7.",
    "BDIvo_0036_0030": "It's all the same in the end.\r\nNow show me a good fight!",
    "BDIvo_0037_0000": "This could be an easy victory with your\r\nhelp.",
    "BDIvo_0037_0010": "The spatial resources here must not be\r\nworth much, given what guards them.",
    "BDIvo_0037_0020": "They should feel honored I'm humoring\r\nthem with even half my power.",
    "BDIvo_0037_0030": "You're still a force to be reckoned\r\nwith, even when holding back.\r\nI'll take it you've got this covered.",
    "BDIvo_0038_0000": "Serve me well today, boy.",
    "BDIvo_0038_0010": "I fight for everyone. Not you.",
    "BDIvo_0038_0020": "Such spine. You'd find this all so much\r\nsimpler serving under my heel,\r\nyou know.",
    "BDIvo_0039_0000": "Yui, hide in my pocket\r\nif you get scared, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0039_0010": "Okay! But I'm sure you\r\nand I can defeat all who\r\nstand in our way, Daddy!",
    "BDIvo_0039_0020": "Ha ha, that's my girl.\r\nLet's show them the family that\r\nslays together stays together!",
    "BDIvo_0040_0000": "Just watch me, Daddy!\r\nI can fight too!",
    "BDIvo_0040_0010": "Wow, I hear kids grow up\r\nfast, but this is a little too\r\nfast, wouldn't you say?",
    "BDIvo_0040_0020": "Hey, you don't believe me, do you?\r\nWell, just you wait! I'll show you!",
    "BDIvo_0041_0000": "Back me up, Sinonon!",
    "BDIvo_0041_0010": "You've got it, Asuna!\r\nGo out there and raise some hell!",
    "BDIvo_0041_0020": "Thanks! All right then,\r\nI'm going to give it my all!",
    "BDIvo_0042_0000": "Multiple enemies approaching from up\r\nahead. I'll do what I can to help,\r\nbut be sure to watch yourself, Asuna.",
    "BDIvo_0042_0010": "No worries, Sinonon.\r\nIf it's kill or be killed,\r\nthen I'll be doing all the killing!",
    "BDIvo_0042_0020": "Haha, jeez. No wonder people call you the Berserk Healer.",
    "BDIvo_0043_0000": "Hey Leafa, can you watch my back?",
    "BDIvo_0043_0010": "Count on me! These guys are gonna get\r\na crash course in death from above!",
    "BDIvo_0043_0020": "Thanks! Then let's get them!",
    "BDIvo_0044_0000": "I'll be on defense and healing,\r\nso just stab, stab, and stab away!",
    "BDIvo_0044_0010": "Thanks.",
    "BDIvo_0044_0020": "Might not be long before folks start\r\ncalling you, \"Berserk Healer Mark II.\"",
    "BDIvo_0044_0030": "What?! N-No, anything but that!",
    "BDIvo_0045_0000": "Hey, Liz, that rapier you made me's\r\nworking great!",
    "BDIvo_0045_0010": "Hah, well, what'd you expect?\r\nAxes, lances, swords—\r\nEverything I touch turns to gold!",
    "BDIvo_0045_0020": "Hehe, then I'd better round you up\r\na hefty customer base!",
    "BDIvo_0046_0000": "All right, Vice Commander,\r\nyou've got point!",
    "BDIvo_0046_0010": "On it! Just leave it to me, Liz!",
    "BDIvo_0046_0020": "Charge away! I've got your back!",
    "BDIvo_0047_0000": "Silica, Pina, I've got the rear!",
    "BDIvo_0047_0010": "What?! I'm the vanguard?!",
    "BDIvo_0047_0020": "Ahaha, just kidding!\r\nLet's take down the frontline together!",
    "BDIvo_0048_0000": "Asuna! I'll need your help today!",
    "BDIvo_0048_0010": "Likewise, Silica! Let's both\r\naim to be today's MVP!",
    "BDIvo_0048_0020": "MVP?! I like the sound of that!",
    "BDIvo_0049_0000": "Hey, Yuuki! What kind of quest do you\r\nwant to take on today?",
    "BDIvo_0049_0010": "Hmm, how about something\r\nreal challenging that no one\r\nelse has beaten?",
    "BDIvo_0049_0020": "Huh? A-Are you sure about that?!",
    "BDIvo_0049_0030": "Heck yeah, I am! The word impossible\r\ndoesn't mean anything to us! We can complete any quest there is in style!",
    "BDIvo_0049_0040": "Together, we're invincible!",
    "BDIvo_0050_0000": "Asuna! I'm gonna paint the town red\r\nwith these monsters today!",
    "BDIvo_0050_0010": "Hey! Don't hog all the fun, Yuuki!",
    "BDIvo_0050_0020": "Fine, I'll leave a few for you!",
    "BDIvo_0051_0000": "I'll leave the scouting to you, Argo!",
    "BDIvo_0051_0010": "You got it! I'll give you a special\r\ndiscount on the info as thanks!",
    "BDIvo_0051_0020": "I-I have to pay for it?",
    "BDIvo_0052_0000": "Hey, got any good intel?",
    "BDIvo_0052_0010": "How about, \"I'm today's MVP\"?",
    "BDIvo_0052_0020": "How's that for info?",
    "BDIvo_0052_0030": "I like the enthusiasm,\r\nbut that's not what I meant!",
    "BDIvo_0053_0000": "Klein! I'm counting on you!",
    "BDIvo_0053_0010": "Don't worry! This'll be a\r\ncruise! Like the Titanic!",
    "BDIvo_0053_0020": "Like the... What?!",
    "BDIvo_0054_0000": "Hehe. Hey, Asuna, are you ready\r\nto see something cool today?",
    "BDIvo_0054_0010": "Coming from you Klein,\r\nthat actually makes me worry.",
    "BDIvo_0054_0020": "Hey, I've an ace up my sleeve.\r\nI can handle everything. It'll be fine.",
    "BDIvo_0055_0000": "What's your take on the situation,\r\nAgil?",
    "BDIvo_0055_0010": "Hmm... Hard to tell without\r\ngetting closer. We should try\r\nand get the drop on them.",
    "BDIvo_0055_0020": "All right, then I'll strike first.\r\nBack me up, Agil!",
    "BDIvo_0056_0000": "Asuna! Leave the lead to me! I'm gonna\r\nwipe the floor with these guys!",
    "BDIvo_0056_0010": "Thanks! I'll clean up so there's no\r\nawkward surprises!",
    "BDIvo_0056_0020": "Sounds great!",
    "BDIvo_0057_0000": "That rabbit outfit is so cute!",
    "BDIvo_0057_0010": "Hey, thanks! I really like it too!",
    "BDIvo_0057_0020": "Hmm, a pink outfit.\r\nMaybe I should try something similar.",
    "BDIvo_0058_0000": "You're known as the Lightning Flash,\r\nright Asuna?",
    "BDIvo_0058_0010": "Yeah, though I actually find it kind of\r\nembarrassing.",
    "BDIvo_0058_0020": "Oh, but I hear they call you the\r\nPink Devil.",
    "BDIvo_0058_0030": "Ack! Busted!\r\nThat name makes me so flustered!",
    "BDIvo_0059_0000": "Could you stop blasting away when\r\nI'm in front of you, Fukaziroh?\r\nIt really freaks me out.",
    "BDIvo_0059_0010": "Hmph, you'll need to take\r\nthat up with Rightony and\r\nLeftania, m'lady.",
    "BDIvo_0059_0020": "Jeez! Even if I do, you'll fire\r\nthem straight into the crowd \r\nanyway.",
    "BDIvo_0060_0000": "All right, why don't we\r\nliven this party up with\r\nsome fireworks?!",
    "BDIvo_0060_0010": "Just don't get too trigger happy,\r\nall right? Otherwise you'll blow\r\nus all to smithereens.",
    "BDIvo_0060_0020": "Tch. Even I can't turn down a request\r\nfrom the Knights of the Blood Oath's\r\nVice Commander.",
    "BDIvo_0061_0000": "Let's fight hard, Alice!",
    "BDIvo_0061_0010": "Indeed, we shall battle together.\r\nThough there is something\r\nI refuse to yield to you.",
    "BDIvo_0061_0020": "We can talk long and hard about\r\nthat once this fight's over, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0062_0000": "Asuna, can I take point this time?",
    "BDIvo_0062_0010": "I don't know, can you?\r\nI should warn you, I'm pretty fast.",
    "BDIvo_0062_0020": "Well then, a competition it is!\r\nLet us see which of us can strike\r\nthe enemy down first!",
    "BDIvo_0063_0000": "You know, Kirito's always talking about\r\nyou, Eugeo!",
    "BDIvo_0063_0010": "What? He is? He hasn't been saying\r\nanything weird about me, has he?",
    "BDIvo_0063_0020": "Hehe! We can talk all about it\r\nonce we're done fighting!",
    "BDIvo_0064_0000": "So you're also trained in the\r\nAincrad Style, Asuna?",
    "BDIvo_0064_0010": "Yeah. And I'm quite quick,\r\nif I do say so myself.",
    "BDIvo_0064_0020": "Wow, that's awesome!\r\nShow me what you can do!",
    "BDIvo_0065_0000": "Commander, I'll take the frontline!",
    "BDIvo_0065_0010": "Much thanks. I know I'm\r\nin good hands with you.",
    "BDIvo_0065_0020": "Absolutely! We're going\r\nto win this. I guarantee it!",
    "BDIvo_0066_0000": "Asuna, our victory rests on your\r\nshoulders. I believe in you.",
    "BDIvo_0066_0010": "You can count on me!\r\nI won't let you down.",
    "BDIvo_0066_0020": "Splendid. But no matter how prepared\r\nyou are, you can never be certain.\r\nStay on guard.",
    "BDIvo_0067_0000": "We're on the same side today,\r\nso I'll give you a hand.",
    "BDIvo_0067_0010": "Hmph. All that matters is\r\nyou don't get in my way.",
    "BDIvo_0067_0020": "I'll keep that in mind. But that\r\ngoes for you too, you hear?",
    "BDIvo_0068_0000": "The Lightning Flash... We have\r\nquite the history together.",
    "BDIvo_0068_0010": "That's definitely one way\r\nof putting it. But for the\r\nmoment, we're teammates.",
    "BDIvo_0068_0020": "Tch, crafty little...",
    "BDIvo_0069_0000": "Yuna, as always, you\r\nknow what to do!",
    "BDIvo_0069_0010": "You've got it, Asuna!\r\nA kiss on the cheek, was it?",
    "BDIvo_0069_0020": "Huh?! N-No!",
    "BDIvo_0070_0000": "Asuna, I've got your back!",
    "BDIvo_0070_0010": "Thanks! I'll move ahead!\r\nI won't waste this chance!",
    "BDIvo_0070_0020": "Yeah!",
    "BDIvo_0071_0000": "Hey, do you remember what I\r\ntold you on Floor 40 of Aincrad?",
    "BDIvo_0071_0010": "Tightly knit coordination is the\r\nkey to party battles.",
    "BDIvo_0071_0020": "Good, you'll do just fine. Let's go!",
    "BDIvo_0072_0000": "Enemies approaching from ahead!",
    "BDIvo_0072_0010": "Let's bring them down together.",
    "BDIvo_0072_0020": "Roger! They'll be sorry they messed\r\nwith Asuna and Nautilus of the\r\nKnights of the Blood Oath!",
    "BDIvo_0073_0000": "Sugou, I'll fight alongside you just\r\nthis once.",
    "BDIvo_0073_0010": "Oh? Changed classes to a princess\r\nknight to protect me?",
    "BDIvo_0073_0020": "Protect yourself!\r\nI'm fighting for everyone!",
    "BDIvo_0074_0000": "I'll give you one last chance, Asuna.\r\nBe my Titania, Queen of the Fairies.",
    "BDIvo_0074_0010": "In your dreams.",
    "BDIvo_0074_0020": "Besides, I already became a goddess!\r\nEr, in a game, I mean.",
    "BDIvo_0074_0030": "What?! I never knew you had an account\r\nlike that! Tell me more!",
    "BDIvo_0075_0000": "Quinella, stay in step with me!",
    "BDIvo_0075_0010": "Why should I need to lower myself to\r\nyour level? I rule over all, so be a\r\nloyal subject and fight for me.",
    "BDIvo_0075_0020": "Aaand she's not listening.",
    "BDIvo_0076_0000": "Say, Asuna, are you still capable\r\nof using your goddess powers?",
    "BDIvo_0076_0010": "You mean from the Stacia account?\r\nSorry, not anymore.",
    "BDIvo_0076_0020": "Truly a shame. It would have been such\r\na wonder having my own personal pet\r\ngoddess.",
    "BDIvo_0077_0000": "Yui, hide behind me if you\r\nget scared, okay?!",
    "BDIvo_0077_0010": "Wow! Thanks, Mommy! Daddy said\r\nthe same thing not too long ago!",
    "BDIvo_0077_0020": "A-Are we being too overprotective?",
    "BDIvo_0078_0000": "I'll help you out with my sword skills\r\ntoday, Mommy!",
    "BDIvo_0078_0010": "Wow, you're all fired up, aren't you?\r\nMaybe I'll let you do all the fighting\r\nsomeday!",
    "BDIvo_0078_0020": "I'll do my best to make that dream \r\ncome true!",
    "BDIvo_0079_0000": "Leafa, try to avoid my line of fire\r\nwhen I've set my sights.",
    "BDIvo_0079_0010": "Got it! But, uh, will there be any\r\nkind of signal or anything?",
    "BDIvo_0079_0020": "Normally you can tell because of the\r\nbullet line, but it doesn't show up\r\nfor the first shot of someone hiding.",
    "BDIvo_0079_0030": "You're kidding me! How am I\r\nsupposed to watch out then?!",
    "BDIvo_0080_0000": "Sinon! Can you shoot the boss from\r\nthe air if I carry you up?",
    "BDIvo_0080_0010": "I've never even thought about that.\r\nBut my gun's pretty heavy, you know?",
    "BDIvo_0080_0020": "Holy smokes, you're right!\r\nI should have hit up the gym more!",
    "BDIvo_0081_0000": "Liz, go to town on the targets.\r\nI've got you covered, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0081_0010": "What do you think I am?! A berserker?\r\nAnyhow, I appreciate the vote of\r\nconfidence! Berserker Liz it is!",
    "BDIvo_0081_0020": "Hehe, I can't wait to see the show!",
    "BDIvo_0082_0000": "Hey, Sinon? Do you do your own\r\nmaintenance for that rifle?",
    "BDIvo_0082_0010": "Why yes. It's my partner, so it's\r\nnatural I would look after it.",
    "BDIvo_0082_0020": "Well well, we may have a future\r\nblacksmith in the works. What do\r\nya say to becoming my pupil?",
    "BDIvo_0082_0030": "Hmm, doesn't sound too bad.\r\nI'll think about it.",
    "BDIvo_0083_0000": "I admit, it'd be nice to have a partner\r\nlike Pina.",
    "BDIvo_0083_0010": "I know what you mean!\r\nPina's so capable!",
    "BDIvo_0083_0020": "A scout, decoy, or even a spotter!\r\nThe possibilities are endless.",
    "BDIvo_0083_0030": "Uh... Sinon? That's quite the \r\nimagination you have there.",
    "BDIvo_0084_0000": "Your gun isn't any ordinary weapon,\r\nis it? It's like, how do I put it...",
    "BDIvo_0084_0010": "There's nothing I trust more than this gun.\r\nYou could say it's my true partner.",
    "BDIvo_0084_0020": "Wow, that's so cool. Oh, but Pina's\r\njust as cool, right? Right?!",
    "BDIvo_0085_0000": "I'll provide backup,\r\nso you go out there and go crazy.",
    "BDIvo_0085_0010": "Wow, it's so reassuring having you\r\naround! All righty then, I'm gonna get\r\nout there and tan some monster hide!",
    "BDIvo_0085_0020": "Sure, knock yourself out.\r\nMy gun and I will clear a path for you.",
    "BDIvo_0086_0000": "Sinon, you're such a good shot,\r\nI'd have thought you were using \r\nan aimbot if I didn't know better!",
    "BDIvo_0086_0010": "Thank you. The trick is to always keep\r\nyour cool. That and trust your partner.",
    "BDIvo_0086_0020": "Oh, that gave me the chills! Going head\r\nto head in close combat is great, but\r\nmaybe I should try a gun out sometime!",
    "BDIvo_0087_0000": "So you use claws, Argo? A rather\r\nunconventional choice, don't you agree?",
    "BDIvo_0087_0010": "Hey, I like claws! They're light and\r\neasy to wear! Sure, they're close\r\nrange, but nothin' beats utility!",
    "BDIvo_0087_0020": "Huh. Might not be a bad idea to have\r\none of those as a subweapon in case\r\nof a close-quarters confrontation.",
    "BDIvo_0088_0000": "Hey, your guns are really rare, right?",
    "BDIvo_0088_0010": "Oh, you noticed? Yeah, there's only\r\nabout ten others in its class in GGO.",
    "BDIvo_0088_0020": "Oh... maybe I'll ask ya for an\r\ninterview once this is all done an'\r\ndusted. This is gonna be great!",
    "BDIvo_0089_0000": "Go ahead and charge straight at them,\r\nKlein. I've got your back.",
    "BDIvo_0089_0010": "Thanks! But my beautifully broad\r\nback won't be too distracting, will it?",
    "BDIvo_0089_0020": "The back of your head would make a\r\nwonderful home for my next bullet.",
    "BDIvo_0090_0000": "Hey Sinon, whaddya say you join me\r\nand the boys at Fuurinkazan?\r\nThere's plenty in it for you.",
    "BDIvo_0090_0010": "Hmm... Maybe as a mercenary, if\r\nthat's okay. It depends on what \r\nyou're offering.",
    "BDIvo_0090_0020": "Seriously?! Well firstly, we'd have to\r\nget you hooked up with a matchlock.",
    "BDIvo_0090_0030": "A matchlock?! I've always wanted\r\nto try one of those!",
    "BDIvo_0091_0000": "Agil, could you take care of the\r\nnearby enemies for a while?",
    "BDIvo_0091_0010": "Okay. I'll protect you, so fire away!",
    "BDIvo_0091_0020": "Thanks! Knowing I have you as a shield\r\nmakes me feel so much better!",
    "BDIvo_0092_0000": "Your sniping's saved my skin more times\r\nthan I can count.",
    "BDIvo_0092_0010": "Heh, I'm only as good of a shot as I am\r\nbecause I have you guys covering me.",
    "BDIvo_0092_0020": "Hey, cut it out!\r\nYou're making me blush.",
    "BDIvo_0092_0030": "Anyway, let's blow them all to kingdom\r\ncome! We can mop up the small fry!",
    "BDIvo_0093_0000": "There sure are a lot of enemies. Think\r\nyou can draw their attention, LLENN?",
    "BDIvo_0093_0010": "Roger! Just take your time aiming!",
    "BDIvo_0093_0020": "Thanks. Pairing with an agile attacker\r\nis nice every now and then.",
    "BDIvo_0094_0000": "It feels good knowing I've got BoB\r\nwinner Sinon fighting on my team.",
    "BDIvo_0094_0010": "Hey, don't get cocky.",
    "BDIvo_0094_0020": "The enemy's not gonna go easy\r\non us just because I happened to win\r\na single tournament.",
    "BDIvo_0094_0030": "Oh man, the chills! Fuka and I can only\r\nwish we were cool as our sniper!",
    "BDIvo_0095_0000": "Not that I'm not grateful that you're\r\nplaying decoy, but don't let yourself\r\nget too trigger happy, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0095_0010": "You got it, Legendary Sniper!\r\nDon't you worry, I'm not gonna steal\r\nyour thunder!",
    "BDIvo_0095_0020": "That's not what I meant. I'm just\r\nasking you not to block my shots!",
    "BDIvo_0096_0000": "Sinon! Go to town!\r\nI'll provide support!",
    "BDIvo_0096_0010": "Your support tends to be too wild for\r\nmy tastes. But still, thank you.\r\nTake out the small fry for me!",
    "BDIvo_0096_0020": "Roger roger! Rightony! Leftania!\r\nLet's throw these guys a party\r\nthey'll never forget!",
    "BDIvo_0097_0000": "Alice, you can play tank, right?\r\nPlease, draw the enemies together!",
    "BDIvo_0097_0010": "Ah, I see, at which point you will rush\r\nin and take them out all at once?\r\nAs you wish!",
    "BDIvo_0097_0020": "Thanks! I'm glad we're together\r\nin this party!",
    "BDIvo_0098_0000": "Should a sniper such as yourself really\r\nbe out front, Sinon?",
    "BDIvo_0098_0010": "A true sniper is one who would risk\r\ntheir own life for the perfect shot.",
    "BDIvo_0098_0020": "I see. Perhaps knights and snipers\r\nare not so different after all.",
    "BDIvo_0099_0000": "Eugeo, can you hold off the enemy?",
    "BDIvo_0099_0010": "You can count on me. Your plan is to\r\nshoot them down while I'm keeping\r\nthem busy, yes?",
    "BDIvo_0099_0020": "Correct. No target will escape me,\r\nno matter how far away they may be.",
    "BDIvo_0100_0000": "That's called a gun, isn't it?\r\nLLENN has the same sort of weapon.",
    "BDIvo_0100_0010": "They may both be guns,but submachine\r\nguns and rifles are very different\r\ntools.",
    "BDIvo_0100_0020": "Wow, how fascinating! I'd sure love it\r\nif you could tell me all about them\r\nwhen you get the chance!",
    "BDIvo_0101_0000": "So you're Heathcliff,\r\nthe legendary Divine Blade.\r\nI hope you live up to the stories.",
    "BDIvo_0101_0010": "It's an honor to hear that you know of me. I shall spare no effort to live up\r\nto my reputation.",
    "BDIvo_0101_0020": "Good. Show me what you're made of.",
    "BDIvo_0102_0000": "A gun? I must admit, I'm quite curious\r\nas to how effective those are in this\r\nworld.",
    "BDIvo_0102_0010": "Just like any other weapon, it all comes\r\ndown to the user. Surely you know that?",
    "BDIvo_0102_0020": "Indeed. There is doubtlessly truth\r\nin that. I'll trust your talents.",
    "BDIvo_0103_0000": "Death Gun...\r\nSo we're teammates this time?",
    "BDIvo_0103_0010": "Hmph. For now.",
    "BDIvo_0103_0020": "I've got a lot of mixed feelings about\r\nthis, but at least I can trust you to\r\nland a shot.",
    "BDIvo_0104_0000": "There's room for only one sniper here.\r\nMe.",
    "BDIvo_0104_0010": "Quite sure of yourself, aren't you?\r\nWell, let's find out which one of us\r\ndrops more enemies.",
    "BDIvo_0104_0020": "Heh. Can't wait.",
    "BDIvo_0105_0000": "Could you Chant, Yuna?",
    "BDIvo_0105_0010": "If you want me to sing, I'll have to\r\nbill you for the mic and costume!",
    "BDIvo_0105_0020": "Heh, you're a shrewd businesswoman.\r\nHow much?",
    "BDIvo_0105_0030": "Ahaha, just kidding! You want a song?\r\nComing right up!",
    "BDIvo_0106_0000": "Hey Sinon, do you mind if I belt out\r\na song?",
    "BDIvo_0106_0010": "Fine by me. The rhythm of a song is\r\nperfect for centering a crosshair.",
    "BDIvo_0106_0020": "I don't follow, but whatever!\r\nLet's sing!",
    "BDIvo_0107_0000": "Eiji, could you play support?\r\nI'd like you to drive out the weaker\r\nmobs in the area.",
    "BDIvo_0107_0010": "Got it. I expect some brilliant sniping\r\nfrom you.",
    "BDIvo_0107_0020": "It's not the easiest thing,\r\nbut I'll do my best.",
    "BDIvo_0108_0000": "Sinon, how good is your range?",
    "BDIvo_0108_0010": "Oh? Need me to cover you?",
    "BDIvo_0108_0020": "No, I'd just like you to shoot any\r\nenemies that get close to Yuna.",
    "BDIvo_0109_0000": "Hey, snap out of it.\r\nYou're blocking my line of fire.",
    "BDIvo_0109_0010": "I beg your pardon?! What gall you have\r\nto speak to a king like that!",
    "BDIvo_0109_0020": "Look, my bullets don't care\r\nif you're a king.",
    "BDIvo_0110_0000": "Well, that's a rather intimidating set of\r\nweapons you have there. Not very\r\nlady-like of you, Sinon.",
    "BDIvo_0110_0010": "Gender is irrelevant when it comes\r\nto firepower. Think you could handle\r\na few rounds?",
    "BDIvo_0110_0020": "I-I'd rather not! That thing would\r\nreduce me to Swiss cheese!",
    "BDIvo_0111_0000": "Quinella, stop fighting in ways\r\nthat only benefit yourself.\r\nWe're supposed to be a team here.",
    "BDIvo_0111_0010": "What exactly am I doing wrong?\r\nWhy not synchronize yourself to my\r\nmoves instead?",
    "BDIvo_0111_0020": "Why should I have to do something\r\nso tedious? I'll just move ahead!",
    "BDIvo_0112_0000": "You are an expert in long-range\r\nsupport, are you not, Sinon?\r\nWhat say you serve under me?",
    "BDIvo_0112_0010": "I'll pass. Though I'll consider it\r\nif it's only as a mercenary.",
    "BDIvo_0112_0020": "My, what a shame. And here I believed\r\nyou and Deusolbert would have gotten\r\nalong swimmingly.",
    "BDIvo_0113_0000": "Yui?! I'm shocked your parents let you\r\ncome all the way out here!",
    "BDIvo_0113_0010": "They don't know! I just want to be as\r\nmuch help as I possibly can!",
    "BDIvo_0113_0020": "What?! They're going to kill me\r\nif something happens to you!\r\nI guess you're my responsibility.",
    "BDIvo_0114_0000": "I want to snipe just like you, Sinon!",
    "BDIvo_0114_0010": "Want to take my gun for a spin?",
    "BDIvo_0114_0020": "O-Okay... Whoa! It's so heavy!",
    "BDIvo_0114_0030": "Looks like I'm best suited\r\nfor support after all!",
    "BDIvo_0115_0000": "You know, Liz, no one would expect a\r\ngirl like you to swing around a weapon\r\nlike that.",
    "BDIvo_0115_0010": "Hehehe... Trying to say it looks too big\r\nfor a cutie like me? It feels real good\r\nwhen I hit something with it!",
    "BDIvo_0115_0020": "Wow, lemme give it a try later!",
    "BDIvo_0116_0000": "Hey, Leafa! Let me know if you see\r\nanything cool up there!",
    "BDIvo_0116_0010": "Anything... cool... Oh! There's a bunch\r\nof weak enemies up ahead!",
    "BDIvo_0116_0020": "That's not cool! Jeez, even though you\r\ndon't look like it, you really like to fight.",
    "BDIvo_0117_0000": "Silica! Pina! Let's get out there and show everyone what a great team\r\nwe make!",
    "BDIvo_0117_0010": "Right! Let's snag some sweets and\r\nlisten to one of Yuna's songs once\r\nthis is over!",
    "BDIvo_0117_0020": "Sounds great! All right, let's wipe\r\nthe floor with these enemies!",
    "BDIvo_0118_0000": "Leafa, I'd appreciate it if you could\r\ncover—Wait, huh? Is it just me or \r\nare you kinda pale?",
    "BDIvo_0118_0010": "W-Well, you see, thing is—",
    "BDIvo_0118_0020": "Huh?! You ate a whole tub of ice cream?!\r\nL-Looks like I'll have to work extra hard today!",
    "BDIvo_0119_0000": "Looking forward to seeing some\r\nmore awesome swordplay from\r\nyou, Absolute Sword!",
    "BDIvo_0119_0010": "No, you won't be able to see it from\r\nup there!",
    "BDIvo_0119_0020": "Oh, really? Then we'll have to have\r\ntake the fight to the skies once\r\nwe're done with these guys!",
    "BDIvo_0120_0000": "Your form is so smooth, Leafa!",
    "BDIvo_0120_0010": "Ehehehe! You really think so? Must be\r\nall that kendo training paying off.",
    "BDIvo_0120_0020": "Wow, you do kendo?! I wanna try that\r\nout too! You'll have to give me a\r\ncrash course some time!",
    "BDIvo_0121_0000": "Hey Argo, Kirito told me you know\r\neverything. Is that right?",
    "BDIvo_0121_0010": "For the right price, sure.\r\nWhat do ya wanna know?",
    "BDIvo_0121_0020": "My fortune for today, please!",
    "BDIvo_0121_0030": "Take that up with a fortuneteller.\r\nJeez, what the heck has Kii-boy\r\ntold ya about me?",
    "BDIvo_0122_0000": "Got a pretty balanced character build\r\nthere, Leafa.",
    "BDIvo_0122_0010": "I guess you're right. I figured\r\nI needed one so I could cover\r\nany role the party needed!",
    "BDIvo_0122_0020": "Hmm... It's hard to believe you're\r\nreally that solo player's sister.",
    "BDIvo_0123_0000": "Hey, why do you keep looking all over\r\nthe place? You're not hunting for\r\nchicks, are you?",
    "BDIvo_0123_0010": "*gulp* N-No, no, just making sure\r\nthere're no enemies!",
    "BDIvo_0123_0020": "Did you just gulp? Oh my god,\r\nI was right! Ugh, just focus on \r\nfighting, would you?!",
    "BDIvo_0124_0000": "Hey Leafa. How you feeling?",
    "BDIvo_0124_0010": "I'm on top of the world! I'm ready to\r\ntake down a whole bunch of enemies!",
    "BDIvo_0124_0020": "Glad to hear it!",
    "BDIvo_0124_0030": "Seeing you so pumped up gets me excited\r\ntoo!",
    "BDIvo_0125_0000": "Agil! Back me up!",
    "BDIvo_0125_0010": "You got it! I'll wipe 'em all out with\r\na Whirlwind if needed!",
    "BDIvo_0125_0020": "That's our Agil! I knew I could\r\ncount on you!",
    "BDIvo_0126_0000": "Hey Leafa, those mobs I slapped around\r\nmight be flying up around you.",
    "BDIvo_0126_0010": "I see. In that case, I'll knock 'em all out of the park!",
    "BDIvo_0126_0020": "Oh, glad to know you can get the job\r\ndone. This won't even be a contest\r\nwith us on the job!",
    "BDIvo_0127_0000": "LLENN, go wild and fight as you please!\r\nI've got you covered from above!",
    "BDIvo_0127_0010": "Oh, thanks a bunch! I'll take you up on that and turn 'em all to Swiss cheese!",
    "BDIvo_0127_0020": "Yeah! These guys are gonna regret\r\nthe day they messed with us!",
    "BDIvo_0128_0000": "Hey Leafa, can you heal me\r\nif I get in the red zone?",
    "BDIvo_0128_0010": "You've got it! Just come on back\r\nif things ever get hairy for you!",
    "BDIvo_0128_0020": "Oh, what a wonderful world!\r\nYou're three players wrapped up in one!",
    "BDIvo_0129_0000": "Grenades sound like so much fun!\r\nI wanna try one out too!",
    "BDIvo_0129_0010": "You're darn right they are! What say\r\nyou carry me up into the skies, and\r\nwe'll carpet-bomb those in our way?",
    "BDIvo_0129_0020": "Th-That might be going a little\r\ntoo far.",
    "BDIvo_0130_0000": "I can't see a thing! Guess I'll light\r\nthis place up with a Plasma Grenade!",
    "BDIvo_0130_0010": "Whoa, hold on! I can't fly in here,\r\nso you'll blow me up too!",
    "BDIvo_0130_0020": "Tch. Hey, small fry! Better thank Leafa\r\ncuz this day woulda been your last!",
    "BDIvo_0131_0000": "Appreciate the help, Alice!",
    "BDIvo_0131_0010": "Likewise. I'm grateful for your\r\nairborne support.",
    "BDIvo_0131_0020": "You got the surface, while I got the\r\nskies! What a perfect strategy!",
    "BDIvo_0132_0000": "Grant me your grace, Goddess Terraria!",
    "BDIvo_0132_0010": "Uh, Alice? I'm just Leafa now.",
    "BDIvo_0132_0020": "Heh, I'm well aware. But that doesn't\r\nchange that you fight like a goddess\r\nof war all the same.",
    "BDIvo_0132_0030": "Goddess of war?\r\nThat sounds a bit extreme. But strong!\r\nI'm cool with that, I guess!",
    "BDIvo_0133_0000": "My bro told me all about what a great\r\nswordsman you are!",
    "BDIvo_0133_0010": "Kirito told you about me too?\r\nThat's a bit embarrassing.",
    "BDIvo_0133_0020": "Hehe, now show me if you live up to the\r\nstories!",
    "BDIvo_0134_0000": "\"Bro,\" huh? So he's got family that\r\ncall him that too, does he?",
    "BDIvo_0134_0010": "I'm a little jealous, I must admit.",
    "BDIvo_0134_0020": "Want me to start calling you \"bro\" too,\r\nthen?",
    "BDIvo_0134_0030": "Uh, no, that's not the part I was\r\njealous about.",
    "BDIvo_0134_0040": "But maybe that wouldn't be so bad.",
    "BDIvo_0135_0000": "So you're the Commander of the\r\nKnights of the Blood Oath?\r\nThat armor looks as strong as a tank!",
    "BDIvo_0135_0010": "Mmm. As they say, the best offense is a\r\ngood defense.",
    "BDIvo_0135_0020": "I see. So you're practically invincible\r\nwhen you throw my healing into the mix!",
    "BDIvo_0136_0000": "A flying healer, eh?\r\nThe perfect fit for any party.",
    "BDIvo_0136_0010": "Just let me know if you need any help!",
    "BDIvo_0136_0020": "Hah, I believe I shall take you up on that. Still, be careful. Keep in mind\r\nthat also paints a target on you.",
    "BDIvo_0137_0000": "Hey Death Gun, would you stop going\r\nafter Kirito and Sinon?",
    "BDIvo_0137_0010": "Worry about yourself! I'll shoot you\r\nif you slow me down.",
    "BDIvo_0137_0020": "Me slow you down?! You're talking to\r\nthe Black Swordsman's sister here!",
    "BDIvo_0138_0000": "It's hard to aim when you're flying.",
    "BDIvo_0138_0010": "Hey! You're supposed to\r\naim for the enemies, not me!",
    "BDIvo_0138_0020": "Just dodge.",
    "BDIvo_0138_0030": "Mmph! Selfish jerk!",
    "BDIvo_0139_0000": "Chant and watch out for the enemies,\r\nYuna! Looks like there's tons of 'em!",
    "BDIvo_0139_0010": "Got it. Still, I'm glad to have such a\r\nlarge audience!",
    "BDIvo_0139_0020": "You're still happy go lucky in the face\r\nof all this? That's a real diva!",
    "BDIvo_0140_0000": "Can you hear my singing from all the\r\nway over there, Leafa?",
    "BDIvo_0140_0010": "Yeah! It's echoing through the air!",
    "BDIvo_0140_0020": "Oh good! I'm so glad!",
    "BDIvo_0140_0030": "I'll be cheering you on no matter how\r\nhigh up you go, so don't worry about\r\na thing!",
    "BDIvo_0150_0000": "I'll back you up, so don't go charging\r\nin all by yourself, Eiji!",
    "BDIvo_0150_0010": "No need to tell me. I'm not stupid\r\nenough to be that reckless.",
    "BDIvo_0150_0020": "Good! Then I'll leave it all to you!",
    "BDIvo_0151_0000": "Can you use healing magic?",
    "BDIvo_0151_0010": "Yep! So I've got you covered\r\nif you get hurt!",
    "BDIvo_0151_0020": "Got it.\r\nMake sure you do the same for Yuna.",
    "BDIvo_0152_0000": "The King of the Fairies?\r\nYou sure look the part.",
    "BDIvo_0152_0010": "Indeed. So I shall sit back and drink\r\nmy tea in peace while you peons handle\r\nall the fighting.",
    "BDIvo_0152_0020": "Uh, you're not really what I expected.",
    "BDIvo_0153_0000": "Hmph, a Sylph? Serve me.",
    "BDIvo_0153_0010": "Are you loony?!\r\nI don't serve anyone!",
    "BDIvo_0153_0020": "That's quite the attitude you have,\r\nwench. You truly are that brat's sister.",
    "BDIvo_0154_0000": "You're so pretty, Quinella.",
    "BDIvo_0154_0010": "Hehe, your honesty is appreciated.\r\nI shall grant you the honor to serve\r\nas my sword.",
    "BDIvo_0154_0020": "A-Ahaha, sorry, but, uh,\r\nI think I'll have to pass.",
    "BDIvo_0155_0000": "I wish I had a servant who could fly\r\nas you can, Leafa.",
    "BDIvo_0155_0010": "S-Servant?! I'm not interested in\r\nbeing a servant!",
    "BDIvo_0155_0020": "No need to fret. I cannot perform the\r\nritual here. It is a shame though.",
    "BDIvo_0156_0000": "Yui, come to me if you need anything!",
    "BDIvo_0156_0010": "Thank you so much, Leafa!\r\nI'll take you up on that!",
    "BDIvo_0156_0020": "I've gotta protect you so Kazuto can\r\nhave a clear conscience!",
    "BDIvo_0157_0000": "It's not every day I get to fight with\r\nyou, Yui!",
    "BDIvo_0157_0010": "I know, right? Let's give everyone\r\nthe support they need today!",
    "BDIvo_0157_0020": "Yeah! We could take on a whole\r\narmy together!",
    "BDIvo_0158_0000": "Heya, Silica! How you feeling?",
    "BDIvo_0158_0010": "Great! I'm gonna get out there and be\r\ntoday's MVP!",
    "BDIvo_0158_0020": "Huh? Oh, is that a challenge\r\nI hear?! You're on!",
    "BDIvo_0158_0030": "Huh? Wait, how did this happen?!",
    "BDIvo_0159_0000": "Hey, Liz!\r\nPina and I are feeling great today!",
    "BDIvo_0159_0010": "Awesome!\r\nI'll be counting on your support!",
    "BDIvo_0159_0020": "Is it just me or are you always putting\r\nme on support?",
    "BDIvo_0159_0030": "Oh w-well, let's just go!",
    "BDIvo_0160_0000": "Looks like this fight's gonna be a piece\r\nof cake with the Absolute Sword around!",
    "BDIvo_0160_0010": "Hey, you don't know that.\r\nI'm not always perfect!",
    "BDIvo_0160_0020": "Well, if things do go south,\r\nI'll just tag in! I've got your back!",
    "BDIvo_0161_0000": "You're a blacksmith, right, Lisbeth?\r\nCould you take a look at my sword later?",
    "BDIvo_0161_0010": "Sure thing! The thought of getting\r\nto handle the Absolute Sword's\r\nblade is exciting!",
    "BDIvo_0161_0020": "Woohoo! Thanks! I'll be sure to kick\r\ntons of butt out there!",
    "BDIvo_0162_0000": "Hey Argo, could you gather some info\r\non rare materials and lemme have it?\r\nI'll pay asking price.",
    "BDIvo_0162_0010": "You got it! Always a pleasure doin'\r\nbusiness with a big spender!",
    "BDIvo_0162_0020": "Yeah, it's win-win for the both of us.\r\nI really appreciate it!",
    "BDIvo_0163_0000": "Wow, my claws are all sparkly and shiny\r\nafter your work, Lisbeth!",
    "BDIvo_0163_0010": "Hey, I spare no effort!\r\nBe sure to treat them with care\r\nand keep 'em clean, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0163_0020": "How am I supposed to do that\r\nduring a fight?!",
    "BDIvo_0164_0000": "Klein! When'd you start\r\ncarrying around that hammer?",
    "BDIvo_0164_0010": "It's a memento of my time with Freya!\r\nWhy'd ya have to remind me?!",
    "BDIvo_0164_0020": "S-Sorry... Didn't mean to push\r\nthe Freya button.",
    "BDIvo_0165_0000": "Yo, Liz! I've got a real juicy offer!\r\nYou want to get in on it?",
    "BDIvo_0165_0010": "That sounds pretty sketchy!\r\nLet me guess, the client's\r\na girl, isn't it?",
    "BDIvo_0165_0020": "Y-You idiot! You can't just abandon\r\nsomeone in need! Have a heart!",
    "BDIvo_0166_0000": "Well, you're all smiles.\r\nWhat's up, Agil?",
    "BDIvo_0166_0010": "Oh, it's you, Liz. Well, I was in\r\nthis dungeon the other day \r\nand there was a hidden—",
    "BDIvo_0166_0020": "On second thought, never mind.",
    "BDIvo_0166_0030": "Hey! You can't keep the\r\njuicy bits all to yourself!",
    "BDIvo_0166_0040": "You're spilling the beans later, got it?",
    "BDIvo_0167_0000": "Hi there, Liz.\r\nCraft any cool weapons lately?",
    "BDIvo_0167_0010": "I'm running short on materials.\r\nThere's gotta be a decent stockpile\r\nsomewhere, though.",
    "BDIvo_0167_0020": "Well, in that case, let's go find\r\nourselves some rare materials!",
    "BDIvo_0168_0000": "A submachine gun, eh?\r\nThat seems interesting.",
    "BDIvo_0168_0010": "SMGs are the best! They're light, cute,\r\nand can turn anything into Swiss cheese!",
    "BDIvo_0168_0020": "S-Swiss cheese? Still, I get the love\r\nof a weapon you know you can rely on!",
    "BDIvo_0169_0000": "Could you do some work on\r\nLittle Miss P, Lisbeth?",
    "BDIvo_0169_0010": "I dunno, I've never worked with guns\r\nbefore. Guess I could give it a shot.\r\nNo promises though.",
    "BDIvo_0169_0020": "Huh?! O-On second thought,\r\nI think she's fine for now.\r\nMaybe next time, haha...",
    "BDIvo_0170_0000": "Grenade launchers, eh?\r\nThat's pretty cool.",
    "BDIvo_0170_0010": "Well look here, someone knows quality\r\nwhen she sees it! Wanna shoot 'em?",
    "BDIvo_0170_0020": "Eep! Sure, I'm interested, but this is\r\nmost definitely not the time or place!",
    "BDIvo_0171_0000": "Hey, Liz? Could you modify my launchers\r\nto make 'em even more killer?",
    "BDIvo_0171_0010": "You want me to make them hold more\r\nrounds, don't you? Well, don't blame me\r\nif they turn out crazy huge.",
    "BDIvo_0171_0020": "You actually read my mind?! Hmm...\r\nBigger does sound cooler!",
    "BDIvo_0172_0000": "Heya, Alice! It's time for us to\r\ngo on a rampage!",
    "BDIvo_0172_0010": "Glad you're in high spirits,\r\nbut be sure to keep your guard up.",
    "BDIvo_0172_0020": "Oh come on, having you is as good\r\nas having a whole army! If things\r\nget dicey, just work your magic!",
    "BDIvo_0173_0000": "Would you take a look at my sword later,\r\nLisbeth?",
    "BDIvo_0173_0010": "Wait, you mean I get to hold that sword?\r\nWoohoo! You got it! I'm your girl!",
    "BDIvo_0173_0020": "Wonderful. Then let's slay these\r\nenemies posthaste. Hehe, my sword\r\nseems pleased as well.",
    "BDIvo_0174_0000": "Wow Eugeo, that's a real\r\nsharp sword you got there.",
    "BDIvo_0174_0010": "Thanks. This is called a Divine Object.\r\nThey are extremely rare in my world.",
    "BDIvo_0174_0020": "A Divine Object?! That sounds awesome!\r\nLemme have a look later!",
    "BDIvo_0175_0000": "Rest assured, I shall help you with\r\nmy Sacred Arts, Lisbeth.",
    "BDIvo_0175_0010": "Oh, thanks! It freezes enemies, right?\r\nThat makes it the perfect partner for a mace!",
    "BDIvo_0175_0020": "Ha ha, very true. Let's go and take\r\nthese enemies apart! Literally!",
    "BDIvo_0176_0000": "Heathcliff, huh? You're not gonna turn\r\nout to be the evil mastermind again,\r\nare you?",
    "BDIvo_0176_0010": "My, wouldn't that make for an\r\ninteresting tale? But we must deal\r\nwith the foes before us first.",
    "BDIvo_0176_0020": "Tale? That's literally what happened.\r\nOh well. Glad you're on my side for now!",
    "BDIvo_0177_0000": "You seem to be in rather hearty spirits,\r\nLisbeth.",
    "BDIvo_0177_0010": "That's 'cause I keep finding one rare\r\nitem after another! I can make some\r\ngreat weapons with these!",
    "BDIvo_0177_0020": "Hmm, I admire your spirit,\r\nbut do take care not to get too\r\ndistracted and caught off-guard.",
    "BDIvo_0178_0000": "You're a sniper too, right, Death Gun?",
    "BDIvo_0178_0010": "I fight close-up, too.\r\nI've no weaknesses. Care to see?",
    "BDIvo_0178_0020": "Of course not!\r\nJeez, you need a chill pill!",
    "BDIvo_0179_0000": "An estoc, eh? Don't see those every\r\nday.Looks like it's seen regular use,\r\ntoo. Can I take a peek later?",
    "BDIvo_0179_0010": "...I'll put you lower on my list.",
    "BDIvo_0179_0020": "L-Lower?! What's that supposed to\r\nmean?! I can't tune up your weapon if\r\nsomething happens to me!",
    "BDIvo_0180_0000": "Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm\r\nthis close to Yuna! This is like\r\nhaving front row seats!",
    "BDIvo_0180_0010": "More like a backstage pass!\r\nLet's have some fun, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0180_0020": "You got it! Oh man, Silica's gonna be\r\nso jealous when she hears about this!",
    "BDIvo_0181_0000": "Hey, Lisbeth? Could you make my mic\r\ninto something really cool?",
    "BDIvo_0181_0010": "Hmm... What if I modified it\r\ninto a weapon?",
    "BDIvo_0181_0020": "Then you could whack the heck outta\r\nenemies with it.",
    "BDIvo_0181_0030": "Ahaha, sounds like fun! I'll go ask Eij iwhat he thinks once we're done fighting!",
    "BDIvo_0182_0000": "It's reassuring to have you fighting on\r\nmy side, Eiji!",
    "BDIvo_0182_0010": "We have the same objective, and it'll\r\nbe easier to accomplish together.\r\nThat's all there is to it.",
    "BDIvo_0182_0020": "Yeesh, you can drop the tough guy act,\r\nyou know!",
    "BDIvo_0183_0000": "Yuna told me something strange not\r\ntoo long ago. She said she was thinking\r\nof having you modify her mic.",
    "BDIvo_0183_0010": "Hehe, I know just what to do with that!\r\nI'll make it shoot mind-scrambling\r\nsounds or something!",
    "BDIvo_0183_0020": "Don't. Please.",
    "BDIvo_0184_0000": "Hmm? The Fairy King? Looks like\r\nwe got a real big shot over here.",
    "BDIvo_0184_0010": "Hehehe, you can tell?\r\nWhat a wise leprechaun you are.",
    "BDIvo_0184_0020": "Uh, no, I didn't mean that seriously.\r\nCan you even lift a weapon?",
    "BDIvo_0185_0000": "Ah, a leprechaun. Be honored, for you\r\nare in the presence of the Fairy King.",
    "BDIvo_0185_0010": "Pfft! I would if you were worthy of it!\r\nDo anything to my friends again,\r\nand I swear—",
    "BDIvo_0185_0020": "Hmph. Eliminating these enemies takes\r\npriority at the moment. Now, go forth\r\nand fight for your king!",
    "BDIvo_0185_0030": "In your dreams!",
    "BDIvo_0185_0040": "Jeez, I'll be keeping an eye on you,\r\nso go and fight your own battles!",
    "BDIvo_0186_0000": "Are you strong, Quinella?\r\nI can't help but notice how\r\nconservatively equipped you are.",
    "BDIvo_0186_0010": "Hah, come along if you wish to\r\nsee just how powerful I truly am.",
    "BDIvo_0186_0020": "Confident, aren't you?\r\nI like that in a comrade.\r\nOkay then, I'll take you up on that!",
    "BDIvo_0187_0000": "So you are a blacksmith?\r\nWhat would you say to being my servant?\r\nYou would service Divine Objects.",
    "BDIvo_0187_0010": "As much as I'd like to say I'm\r\nnot interested, you had me\r\nat \"Divine Objects\"!",
    "BDIvo_0187_0020": "I certainly wouldn't mind\r\ngranting you the honor of\r\nholding the sword I crafted.",
    "BDIvo_0188_0000": "Won't Kirito scold you for putting\r\nyourself in danger, Yui?",
    "BDIvo_0188_0010": "Oh, it'll be fine. I'll just hide\r\nbehind you if it gets too dangerous!",
    "BDIvo_0188_0020": "I dunno if that's much better,\r\nbut you're cute, so whatever!",
    "BDIvo_0189_0000": "Would you enhance my sword, Liz?",
    "BDIvo_0189_0010": "You got it! Want something sharp enough\r\nto split a man in two?",
    "BDIvo_0189_0020": "Th-That would be a bit extreme!\r\nI'd be too scared to hold it!",
    "BDIvo_0190_0000": "Let's do everything we can, Yuuki!",
    "BDIvo_0190_0010": "Wow, it's the adorable beast tamer!\r\nLet's give it our all!",
    "BDIvo_0190_0020": "Huh?! Adorable?\r\nUh, you mean Pina, right?",
    "BDIvo_0191_0000": "You're a beast tamer, eh?\r\nGotta admit, I wish I had a little\r\nbuddy everywhere I went too!",
    "BDIvo_0191_0010": "Oh, it's the best! I can do anything\r\nwith Pina around! You can feel free\r\nto rely on her too!",
    "BDIvo_0191_0020": "Ahaha, thanks!\r\nI'll take you up on that!",
    "BDIvo_0192_0000": "Please let me know if you get any new\r\ninformation, okay, Argo?!",
    "BDIvo_0192_0010": "Y'got it!\r\nNow, 'bout the fee...",
    "BDIvo_0192_0020": "I-I should have known\r\nnothing comes free from you.",
    "BDIvo_0193_0000": "Sure is great havin' a partner, huh?",
    "BDIvo_0193_0010": "Yep! Pina and I can take on anything!",
    "BDIvo_0193_0020": "Hmm, who knows what kinds of juicy scoops\r\nI'd find if I had one of those?",
    "BDIvo_0194_0000": "Let me know when you\r\nneed support, Klein!",
    "BDIvo_0194_0010": "Thanks! Same to you!\r\nSay the word and I got your back!",
    "BDIvo_0194_0020": "Thanks a bunch.\r\nI'll turn to you if Pina can't help!",
    "BDIvo_0195_0000": "Hey there, Silica! And you too, Pina!\r\nYou're looking ready to go today!",
    "BDIvo_0195_0010": "Yep! We're gonna be today's MVPs\r\nif it's the last thing we do!",
    "BDIvo_0195_0020": "Heh, challenge accepted!",
    "BDIvo_0196_0000": "Agil! How's our chances?",
    "BDIvo_0196_0010": "Could be pretty slim, honestly.",
    "BDIvo_0196_0020": "But aren't you interested in an item\r\nthat could power up Pina?",
    "BDIvo_0196_0030": "What?! You sure have the soul\r\nof an entrepreneur. But yes,\r\nI'd be lying if I said I wasn't.",
    "BDIvo_0197_0000": "Silica! Pina! Let's do this!",
    "BDIvo_0197_0010": "Thank you so much, Agil!\r\nHmm. I see.\r\nPina says thanks too!",
    "BDIvo_0197_0020": "I don't know why, but seeing that\r\nreally warms the ol' heart.",
    "BDIvo_0198_0000": "Fight over there, Pina.\r\nIt's too dangerous near LLENN.",
    "BDIvo_0198_0010": "What?! Come on, it's all good!\r\nDon't be scared,\r\nI'm not gonna hurt you!",
    "BDIvo_0198_0020": "Sh-She scares me, Pina...",
    "BDIvo_0199_0000": "Come to think of it...\r\nPina's a \"Little Miss P\" too, right?",
    "BDIvo_0199_0010": "\"Too\"?\r\nWait, what other Little Miss P is there?",
    "BDIvo_0199_0020": "Eheh heh, I know we'll get along great\r\nwith our Little Miss Ps! Let's do this!",
    "BDIvo_0200_0000": "Your grenade launchers sure pack a\r\npunch, Fukaziroh! They're so efficient!",
    "BDIvo_0200_0010": "Heh heh. Get too close,\r\nand you'll get burned, missy!",
    "BDIvo_0200_0020": "What?! Pi-Pina, let's get out of here!\r\nShe's going to turn us to charcoal!",
    "BDIvo_0201_0000": "Wow, Pina breathes fire too?! She'll be\r\ngood friends with Rightony and Leftania!",
    "BDIvo_0201_0010": "But Pina's not a grenade launcher.",
    "BDIvo_0201_0020": "Please don't compare Pina to a violent\r\nweapon!",
    "BDIvo_0201_0030": "Hey, I may be violent, but Rightony\r\nand Leftania are super gentle!",
    "BDIvo_0202_0000": "Are you nervous, Alice? I'll be backing you up, so let yourself relax a little.",
    "BDIvo_0202_0010": "A baby Flying Dragon? What a delight!\r\nG-Goodness! How could I be so careless\r\nas to drop my guard?!",
    "BDIvo_0202_0020": "Whoops, it had the opposite effect.",
    "BDIvo_0203_0000": "Can your baby Flying Dragon\r\nfight already?",
    "BDIvo_0203_0010": "Of course. Pina always bails me\r\nout of sticky situations.",
    "BDIvo_0203_0020": "I see.\r\nHee hee, reminds me of Amayori.",
    "BDIvo_0203_0030": "I certainly would love to soar\r\nthrough the sky together once more.",
    "BDIvo_0204_0000": "I can't wait to see your\r\nSacred Arts, Eugeo!",
    "BDIvo_0204_0010": "Hello there, Silica. I've been eagerly\r\nawaiting to fight by your side.\r\nLet's do our best!",
    "BDIvo_0204_0020": "Wow, Pina's looking forward to it too!\r\nAll righty then, Pina, let's do all we\r\ncan!",
    "BDIvo_0205_0000": "Say, Silica? Will Pina someday be big enough for you to fly on her?",
    "BDIvo_0205_0010": "Huh? You know, I've never actually\r\nthought about it. That would be fun!",
    "BDIvo_0205_0020": "I'd sure like to ride her...\r\nBut maybe not if those claws are involved...",
    "BDIvo_0206_0000": "Let's do our best, Heathcliff!",
    "BDIvo_0206_0010": "Indeed. I am expecting a good showing\r\nfrom you and Pina.",
    "BDIvo_0206_0020": "Eheheh, did you hear that, Pina?\r\nThe commander's counting on us!",
    "BDIvo_0207_0000": "Are you ready, Silica?",
    "BDIvo_0207_0010": "Sure am, Heathcliff! Let's show him\r\nwhat a great combo we make, Pina!",
    "BDIvo_0207_0020": "Good, you're certainly not lacking\r\nfor enthusiasm. I expect your\r\npresence will be beneficial.",
    "BDIvo_0208_0000": "It always scares me to look at you,\r\nDeath Gun.",
    "BDIvo_0208_0010": "Hmph. I refuse to act a coward and be\r\nmocked like you.",
    "BDIvo_0208_0020": "I-I'm not a coward,\r\nand people don't mock me either!\r\nI'll show you exactly what I'm made of!",
    "BDIvo_0209_0000": "Noisy brat.\r\nMake too much noise, and I'll shoot you.",
    "BDIvo_0209_0010": "Hey! I'm not noisy!\r\nIsn't that right, Pina? Pina?!",
    "BDIvo_0209_0020": "Hey, stop poking! Look, fine. I won't shoot you, so just stop poking!",
    "BDIvo_0210_0000": "I can't believe I'm actually fighting\r\nwith the real Yuna! Pinch me,\r\nI must be dreaming!",
    "BDIvo_0210_0010": "Ahaha, it's no dream! I'm gonna sing for you today, Silica, so go for it!",
    "BDIvo_0210_0020": "But I might get so lost in your songs\r\nthat I'll forget to fight.",
    "BDIvo_0210_0030": "Nudge me if I ever zone out, okay Pina?",
    "BDIvo_0211_0000": "Ngh, I wish I could've taken my time\r\nlistening to Yuna sing.",
    "BDIvo_0211_0010": "Then why don't I put on a concert\r\nfor you once we finish this up?",
    "BDIvo_0211_0020": "What?! You really mean that? I'm going\r\nto work extra quick on these guys then!",
    "BDIvo_0212_0000": "I'm looking forward to seeing you fight like you did in Underworld, Eiji!",
    "BDIvo_0212_0010": "I only did what I had to. Though,\r\nI'll do what I can this time as well.",
    "BDIvo_0212_0020": "Thanks, can't wait! Don't you think\r\nEiji's a bit nicer now, Pina?",
    "BDIvo_0213_0000": "Are you a fan of Yuna's?",
    "BDIvo_0213_0010": "I'm the biggest fan ever! If you'd like,\r\nI could even sing one of her songs now!",
    "BDIvo_0213_0020": "Huh? Oh, uh, no, that's fine.\r\nWhy not sing with Yuna next time\r\nyou two are together?",
    "BDIvo_0214_0000": "Wow, look Pina, it's amazing!\r\nThe King of the Fairies is here!",
    "BDIvo_0214_0010": "I am no spectacle for your amusement,\r\nCait Sith wench!",
    "BDIvo_0214_0020": "Oh wow, he even talks, too!\r\nIsn't this just the best, Pina?",
    "BDIvo_0215_0000": "Cait Sith beast tamer!\r\nSurely you understand the hierarchy\r\nbetween master and servant!",
    "BDIvo_0215_0010": "We're not like that!\r\nWe're friends!",
    "BDIvo_0215_0020": "Oh really? Well, I suppose it doesn't\r\nmatter, seeing as you're both my\r\nservants. So go forth and serve.",
    "BDIvo_0216_0000": "Please stay close, Quinella!\r\nPina and I will provide support!",
    "BDIvo_0216_0010": "Well, well, what have we here?\r\nA little knight and a little dragon?\r\nThat brings back memories.",
    "BDIvo_0216_0020": "Don't know what you're talking about,\r\nbut we're still strong, small or not!",
    "BDIvo_0217_0000": "That Flying Dragon will be a fine beast\r\nfor an Integrity Knight to mount once\r\nshe has fully grown.",
    "BDIvo_0217_0010": "What's that, Pina? Hmm, I see.\r\nSo you'd let me ride, but not Quinella?",
    "BDIvo_0217_0020": "These kids...\r\nAre surprisingly bold...",
    "BDIvo_0218_0000": "Yui! Let's get through this together!",
    "BDIvo_0218_0010": "Yeah! We need to stick together\r\nas fellow members of the\r\nTiny People's Guild!",
    "BDIvo_0218_0020": "Tiny People's Guild?!\r\nWh-When did we join that, Pina?",
    "BDIvo_0219_0000": "I want to be a beast tamer too, Silica!",
    "BDIvo_0219_0010": "Oh really? What kind of partner\r\nwould you want?",
    "BDIvo_0219_0020": "Well, a giant whale, maybe?\r\nI'll ask Mommy and Daddy!",
    "BDIvo_0220_0000": "Heya, Info Broker. How's business?",
    "BDIvo_0220_0010": "Eh, I've seen better days.\r\nOh, but I got my hands on some real\r\njuicy tidbits the other day.",
    "BDIvo_0220_0020": "Then let me in on it!\r\nIt had better be good!",
    "BDIvo_0221_0000": "Hiya, Absolute Sword. That article\r\nfrom the other day got good reception.\r\nMight be comin' back to ya again!",
    "BDIvo_0221_0010": "Hahaha, stop with the business talk!\r\nIt's time to go wild! Let's tear it up!",
    "BDIvo_0221_0020": "Boy, would I love to!\r\nBut I don't think my body could take it!",
    "BDIvo_0222_0000": "Katana really are the coolest, aren't\r\nthey? Reminds me of Asuka Empire!",
    "BDIvo_0222_0010": "Oh, you noticed?\r\nThis baby's pretty sharp!",
    "BDIvo_0222_0020": "Heck yeah, it is!\r\nWhat do you say we go to Asuka Empire\r\ntogether some time?",
    "BDIvo_0223_0000": "Heh heh, you look like you're\r\nrarin' to go, Yuuki! I'm pretty\r\nfired up, myself!",
    "BDIvo_0223_0010": "You're a good swordsman, so I\r\ncan't wait to see who can kick more\r\nmonster butt!",
    "BDIvo_0223_0020": "How about the loser treats the winner\r\nto lunch? That way we'll both try hard!",
    "BDIvo_0223_0030": "Sounds great!\r\nBut you can bet you'll be the one\r\npaying up when all's said and done!",
    "BDIvo_0224_0000": "Man, you're so big and strong, Agil! I'm jealous!",
    "BDIvo_0224_0010": "Really? But you're super fast. That's something I can't say for me.",
    "BDIvo_0224_0020": "Which means the two of us are unstoppable when we put our talents\r\ntogether! We make a great team!",
    "BDIvo_0225_0000": "Hey Agil, you have a wife\r\nin The Real World, right?",
    "BDIvo_0225_0010": "I'm surprised you knew.\r\nBut yeah. She likes games too.\r\nThat's actually how we first met.",
    "BDIvo_0225_0020": "Wow, that sounds awesome!\r\nI also want a wife who likes games!",
    "BDIvo_0226_0000": "So, which is faster?\r\nYour bullets or my sword?",
    "BDIvo_0226_0010": "Why don't we find out? But just so you\r\nknow, I'm not holding back!",
    "BDIvo_0226_0020": "All right, then let's give it a test\r\nonce this is over!",
    "BDIvo_0227_0000": "It's key for fast-attackers to\r\ngain control of the frontlines!\r\nLet's do this!",
    "BDIvo_0227_0010": "Ha, don't think I'll let you take point\r\nso easi—Whoa, she's fast!\r\nI don't know if I can keep up!",
    "BDIvo_0227_0020": "Huh? Did I hear something?\r\nNah, must've been my imagination!",
    "BDIvo_0228_0000": "You sure know how to make\r\nevery fight a party, Fukaziroh.",
    "BDIvo_0228_0010": "Yeah, never a dull moment with me\r\naround! So whaddya say to a few\r\nfireworks to make this a real blast?!",
    "BDIvo_0228_0020": "Whoa, whoa!\r\nDon't fire 'em right here!\r\nYou'll blow us up!",
    "BDIvo_0229_0000": "Heya, Yuuki! Come to me if things are\r\nlooking dangerous, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0229_0010": "Sure, thanks! But I think you're\r\nthe biggest danger of all!",
    "BDIvo_0229_0020": "Ha ha ha, you know me too well!\r\nSorry in advance if I make you go\r\nboom by mistake!",
    "BDIvo_0230_0000": "You're a master swordswoman,\r\nright Alice?",
    "BDIvo_0230_0010": "Indeed. I also hear you've been dubbed\r\nthe Absolute Sword. I would very much\r\nlike to test my skill against yours.",
    "BDIvo_0230_0020": "Awesome! Then let's throw down once\r\nwe're done here!",
    "BDIvo_0231_0000": "I look forward to seeing what sword\r\nskills have merited you the title of\r\nAbsolute Sword.",
    "BDIvo_0231_0010": "Oh, you'll find out!\r\nBe sure to take this seriously!",
    "BDIvo_0231_0020": "Yes, absolutely.\r\nThe soul of my blade shall shine!",
    "BDIvo_0232_0000": "Release Recollection is so pretty!\r\nI'd sure love a to learn a skill like that!",
    "BDIvo_0232_0010": "Well, you may be able to learn it\r\nshould you ever come to my world.",
    "BDIvo_0232_0020": "Your world, huh?\r\nI'd sure love to see it someday!",
    "BDIvo_0233_0000": "Kirito told me about you.\r\nAre you really stronger than him?",
    "BDIvo_0233_0010": "I mean, sure, I beat him once, but I\r\ndon't know if I could pull it off again.",
    "BDIvo_0233_0020": "That's still amazing!\r\nWould you duel me once we're done here?",
    "BDIvo_0233_0030": "Fine by me!\r\nLet's get a move on and wrap this up!",
    "BDIvo_0234_0000": "A shield sure comes in handy,\r\nbut it looks hard to use.",
    "BDIvo_0234_0010": "Well, it allows you to switch between attack and defense, but you have to be\r\nquick on your feet.",
    "BDIvo_0234_0020": "I see. Well, I fight sword-first,\r\nso I doubt a shield would suit me.",
    "BDIvo_0235_0000": "I would appreciate it if you would lend\r\nus your strength, Yuuki.",
    "BDIvo_0235_0010": "No need to ask twice!\r\nI'm ready to take center stage!",
    "BDIvo_0235_0020": "Splendid. I look forward to the\r\nAbsolute Sword's strength.\r\nShow me how you earned that title.",
    "BDIvo_0236_0000": "That's a funny mask you've got there,\r\nDeath Gun! Can you even see in that thing?",
    "BDIvo_0236_0010": "Watch your back.\r\nI can shoot you from any distance.",
    "BDIvo_0236_0020": "Haha, sorry!\r\nI bet your aim rocks!",
    "BDIvo_0237_0000": "The Absolute Sword? Quite the title.\r\nSlow me down and you'll regret it.",
    "BDIvo_0237_0010": "No worries, I won't! You make sure you\r\ndon't get axed off yourself, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0237_0020": "Who do you think I am?\r\nAll enemies are prey to my gun.",
    "BDIvo_0238_0000": "It's so fun to fight while listening to\r\nyou sing!",
    "BDIvo_0238_0010": "Then why don't I go with something\r\nwith a faster tempo?\r\nThat should be even more fun, right?",
    "BDIvo_0238_0020": "Yeah, that'd be great! Thanks!\r\nThese enemies picked the wrong day\r\nto cross our path!",
    "BDIvo_0239_0000": "Hey Yuuki, are my songs helpful?",
    "BDIvo_0239_0010": "You kidding? Hearing you sing makes me\r\nfeel like I can do anything!",
    "BDIvo_0239_0020": "That's wonderful! Then I'll keep\r\nempowering you with my voice!",
    "BDIvo_0240_0000": "What's with the frown, Eiji?\r\nSomething bugging you?",
    "BDIvo_0240_0010": "Hmm, maybe I'm a bit tense deep down.",
    "BDIvo_0240_0020": "Ah, so you're nervous? No need to fear!\r\nI'll be fighting right alongside you!\r\nWe'll do great!",
    "BDIvo_0241_0000": "The Absolute Sword. I might've had a\r\ndifferent future if I had your strength.",
    "BDIvo_0241_0010": "Whether it was happy or sad,\r\nthere's no changing the past.",
    "BDIvo_0241_0020": "You just gotta live in the present with\r\nall your heart! Don't you think so?",
    "BDIvo_0241_0030": "Yeah. I like the way you think.\r\nA positive outlook is good.",
    "BDIvo_0242_0000": "Heya, Oberon! Today feels like\r\na good one! Don't you agree?",
    "BDIvo_0242_0010": "Hmph, a rather carefree attitude\r\nto have on the battlefield.\r\nSure you can afford to be so laid back?",
    "BDIvo_0242_0020": "Ahaha, no worries!\r\nI'm always operating at 120%!",
    "BDIvo_0243_0000": "Why hello, Yuuki. I am the most\r\nimportant figure in this operation, so\r\ndo be sure to guard me, would you?",
    "BDIvo_0243_0010": "Really? Okay, I'll keep you safe!\r\nBut try anything sketchy and there may\r\nbe an accidental wound.",
    "BDIvo_0243_0020": "I suddenly feel cold hearing you say\r\nthat with a smile.",
    "BDIvo_0244_0000": "You're totally rocking the mysterious\r\nbeautiful lady vibe there, Quinella!",
    "BDIvo_0244_0010": "An accomplished swordswoman and an\r\nhonest one. I like that. What would you\r\nsay to becoming an Integrity Knight?",
    "BDIvo_0244_0020": "I'm already in a guild, sorry!\r\nBut let's have some fun together\r\nanother time!",
    "BDIvo_0245_0000": "Your swordsmanship is splendid, Yuuki.\r\nIt would appear I have found another\r\nIntegrity Knight candidate.",
    "BDIvo_0245_0010": "Aren't those Alice's friends?",
    "BDIvo_0245_0020": "Perhaps \"rivals\" would be more accurate.",
    "BDIvo_0246_0000": "You may be small, but you never give up,do you, Yui?",
    "BDIvo_0246_0010": "Nope! I'll do my best to show Mommy\r\nand Daddy how tough I can be!",
    "BDIvo_0246_0020": "That's the spirit! I'll tell 'em all\r\nabout what a great job you did today!",
    "BDIvo_0247_0000": "Mommy once said she wants to share a\r\nyummy cake with you, Yuuki!",
    "BDIvo_0247_0010": "That would be lovely! Let's go out for\r\ncake when this is done. Just you, me,\r\nand your mom!",
    "BDIvo_0247_0020": "I'm so excited!\r\nThen let's finish this fast!",
    "BDIvo_0248_0000": "Heya, Klein. That article 'bout ya got\r\ngood reception. Thanks again.",
    "BDIvo_0248_0010": "Well, of course it did!\r\nSeeing how there's so many ladies out\r\nthere dying to know about me!",
    "BDIvo_0248_0020": "True, the article was a real page\r\nturner. The funny pages, that is.",
    "BDIvo_0249_0000": "Hey, Argo! Hear about any babes\r\nin trouble around town?",
    "BDIvo_0249_0010": "Sure have! Ya up for a job mediatin' a\r\ncute couple goin' through a rough\r\npatch?",
    "BDIvo_0249_0020": "Hell no!\r\nI mean a babe who I can get close to!",
    "BDIvo_0250_0000": "Hey Agil, business boomin' lately?",
    "BDIvo_0250_0010": "Well, the market's been kinda cutthroat,\r\nand I'm on the losing end of it.\r\n*gasp* Wait a second!",
    "BDIvo_0250_0020": "What?! Don't read too much into that!\r\nI'm just being friendly! Honest!",
    "BDIvo_0251_0000": "Hi there, Argo! How much money\r\ndo you think I can make in this field?",
    "BDIvo_0251_0010": "Heh heh, you're in luck!\r\nI've got some shockin' info 'bout that!\r\nBuy now for a special discount!",
    "BDIvo_0251_0020": "I get the feeling you're gonna make me\r\ngive you half my loot.",
    "BDIvo_0252_0000": "Your size is a perfect match for mine,\r\nif I do say so myself.",
    "BDIvo_0252_0010": "Huh? Really? I mean, sure,\r\nI guess it might be good for\r\nscouting and patrolling.",
    "BDIvo_0252_0020": "No, I meant you're inconspicuous.\r\nYour shots make for a great diversion!",
    "BDIvo_0253_0000": "So you're Argo the famous broker?\r\nGlad to have you on my side!",
    "BDIvo_0253_0010": "Same! Don't hesitate to come\r\nto me for help! Payment in\r\nadvance! Thanks!",
    "BDIvo_0253_0020": "What? I have to pay?!",
    "BDIvo_0254_0000": "Hey Fuka, don't go blowing everything\r\nsky high, okay? Makes it a bit hard to see.",
    "BDIvo_0254_0010": "Hey, I don't go blowing things up\r\nwilly-nilly. Just the stuff that\r\nlooks fun to shoot!",
    "BDIvo_0254_0020": "No, no, no!\r\nFor the last time, don't do it!",
    "BDIvo_0255_0000": "Alrighty then, time ta go wild today!\r\nSay Argo, what's the plan?",
    "BDIvo_0255_0010": "Huh? Hmm. Well, I wanna know\r\nwhat the enemy's up to first.",
    "BDIvo_0255_0020": "I'm on it! You can count on me!\r\nI'll blow 'em all to smithereens\r\nwith my grenades!",
    "BDIvo_0255_0030": "Whoa, hey!\r\nThat'd go completely against the plan!",
    "BDIvo_0256_0000": "Looks like you're getting more\r\nused to this world, right?",
    "BDIvo_0256_0010": "Indeed. I am actually concerned I may\r\nbring some odd habits with me when\r\nI return to Underworld.",
    "BDIvo_0256_0020": "Underworld, eh? You're gonna have\r\nta tell me all about it sometime!",
    "BDIvo_0257_0000": "I have a question that has been\r\ntroubling me for a while now—\r\nWhy do you wear whiskers, Argo?",
    "BDIvo_0257_0010": "Ya wanna know? Pay the right fee,\r\nand you can join the club too!",
    "BDIvo_0257_0020": "Join the club? I-I don't like the sound\r\nof that for some reason.",
    "BDIvo_0258_0000": "Hey Eugeo, you can perform Sword Skills\r\nwith the best of 'em, right?",
    "BDIvo_0258_0010": "Shoulda expected nothin' less of\r\nKii-boy's best apprentice!",
    "BDIvo_0258_0020": "I'm sure I have his wonderful teaching\r\nto thank for that.",
    "BDIvo_0258_0030": "So, who's stronger, you or Kii-boy?\r\nI could make a killin' off this info!",
    "BDIvo_0259_0000": "Argo, I'd appreciate it if you could\r\ntell me when the flow of the battle\r\nchanges!",
    "BDIvo_0259_0010": "Ya got it! In exchange for info 'bout\r\nyour world, that is!",
    "BDIvo_0259_0020": "My world? Certainly!\r\nI'll tell you all you want to know!",
    "BDIvo_0260_0000": "Hey, Commander guy,\r\nwhat are your current ambitions?",
    "BDIvo_0260_0010": "Me? To achieve victory through a solid\r\nbattle formation, I suppose.",
    "BDIvo_0260_0020": "I can tell you mean\r\nwhat you say! Looks like\r\nthis'll turn out real juicy!",
    "BDIvo_0261_0000": "I shall be expecting great things of\r\nyour intelligence gathering abilities,\r\nArgo.",
    "BDIvo_0261_0010": "Hahaha, don't expect any freebies\r\njust because you're the commander!",
    "BDIvo_0261_0020": "Of course not.\r\nYou shall be well compensated.",
    "BDIvo_0262_0000": "Wow, I never thought I'd be fightin'\r\nside by side with Death Gun!\r\nWhat a twist!",
    "BDIvo_0262_0010": "Sniff around too much and you'll have\r\nmore than wounds, Argo the Rat.",
    "BDIvo_0262_0020": "Don't think you'll scare me that easy!\r\nGet careless and I'll be sure to write\r\nall about it!",
    "BDIvo_0263_0000": "Info Broker. Best watch what you write\r\nif you know what's good for you.",
    "BDIvo_0263_0010": "I will! Relax!\r\nThe only thing I sell is reliable intel\r\nwith evidence to back it up!",
    "BDIvo_0263_0020": "Tch. Just watch yourself.\r\nGo back on your word and you're dead.",
    "BDIvo_0264_0000": "Your song buffs will make it easier for\r\nme ta scout, Yuna, so I'd appreciate it.",
    "BDIvo_0264_0010": "Really?\r\nThen I'll back you up while you scout!",
    "BDIvo_0264_0020": "Uh, could ya not, actually?\r\nYour singing will give our position away!",
    "BDIvo_0265_0000": "Why aren't you interviewing me, Argo?\r\nAren't you an information dealer?",
    "BDIvo_0265_0010": "Well, people will write about ya\r\nwhether I do or not.\r\nStill, since we're here, why not?",
    "BDIvo_0265_0020": "Oh, I wonder what kind of article\r\nit'll be! Maybe something like,\r\n\"Undercover Coverage on the Diva\"?\r\n",
    "BDIvo_0266_0000": "Hey, Eiji?\r\nHow do you feel about Yuna?",
    "BDIvo_0266_0010": "Why are you trying to sniff up dirt\r\non Yuna?\r\nPlan to write about it in a tabloid?",
    "BDIvo_0266_0020": "Dang, boy's on his guard! But that goes\r\nto show how close the two of you are!",
    "BDIvo_0267_0000": "Oh, you're the Info Broker.\r\nWhat do you make of this?",
    "BDIvo_0267_0010": "I'll give ya a discount on that intel!\r\nI've got all the freshest takes,\r\nready to go!",
    "BDIvo_0267_0020": "Always out to make a quick buck, huh?",
    "BDIvo_0268_0000": "Ooh, the Fairy King!\r\nLooks like I found me an exclusive!",
    "BDIvo_0268_0010": "Hmm? Are you an information broker?\r\nPerfect! Spread the word of my charms\r\nthe world over!",
    "BDIvo_0268_0020": "I'm not gonna sugarcoat anythin' I\r\nwrite, so don't expect me to.",
    "BDIvo_0269_0000": "Lowlife tabloid reporter! You've come\r\nto fabricate a false scandal about me,\r\nhaven't you?! Haven't you?!",
    "BDIvo_0269_0010": "Hey, I take offense at that!\r\nI write the truth!",
    "BDIvo_0269_0020": "Really? Hmph, then I suppose I can\r\nexpect quite the fair article from you.",
    "BDIvo_0269_0030": "Where d'ya get that confidence from?!\r\nThe answer to that is sure to make a\r\ngreat article!",
    "BDIvo_0270_0000": "You're the ruler of Underworld.\r\nRight, Quinella? Can I get an\r\nexclusive from you? Please?",
    "BDIvo_0270_0010": "Hmm, you deal in details?\r\nI shall accept your request should\r\nyou vow to become my servant.",
    "BDIvo_0270_0020": "Uh, I-I could just pay\r\nfor the interview.",
    "BDIvo_0271_0000": "You appear to be skilled in your\r\nintel acquisition, Argo.\r\nWhat would you say to serving me?",
    "BDIvo_0271_0010": "Uh, I appreciate the offer and all,\r\nbut I don't really vibe with the whole\r\n\"evil\" thing.",
    "BDIvo_0271_0020": "You needn't worry on that front.\r\nI am the one and only justice there is.",
    "BDIvo_0271_0030": "Still, feel free to inform me should you\r\nreconsider.",
    "BDIvo_0272_0000": "I'm gonna watch over ya instead of\r\nAsu an' Kii-boy today!",
    "BDIvo_0272_0010": "Thank you so much!\r\nI'll be counting on you, Argo!",
    "BDIvo_0272_0020": "Much as I'd like ta bill your pops for\r\nthe work, I'll do it free just for you!",
    "BDIvo_0273_0000": "Please teach me how\r\nto be stealthy, Argo!",
    "BDIvo_0273_0010": "Sure, I can do that, but ya gotta keep\r\nit a secret from your folks, 'kay?",
    "BDIvo_0273_0020": "Of course! I want to tell them\r\nall about it once I finally get good!",
    "BDIvo_0273_0030": "What part of \"secret\"\r\ndidja not understand?!\r\nForget it, I ain't teachin' today!",
    "BDIvo_0274_0000": "Woohoo! Today's the day the great\r\nKlein becomes the star of the show!",
    "BDIvo_0274_0010": "Tone it down.\r\nOverconfidence will be the death of you.",
    "BDIvo_0274_0020": "Heh heh heh, that's what friends\r\nare for! Back me up, Agil!",
    "BDIvo_0275_0000": "Hey there, Klein. You ready for us to\r\nlead this team to victory?",
    "BDIvo_0275_0010": "Heck yeah, I am!\r\nLet's cut these guys to ribbons!",
    "BDIvo_0275_0020": "That's the spirit! Fighting alongside\r\na true ally is the best!",
    "BDIvo_0276_0000": "Hey there, LLENN! Showing off's great\r\nand all, but give me some time to shine!",
    "BDIvo_0276_0010": "I never hold back in a fight!\r\nI'm gonna shred them down to tiny atoms!",
    "BDIvo_0276_0020": "A tiny girl with a terrifying attitude!",
    "BDIvo_0276_0030": "No wonder they all call you\r\nthe Pink Devil.",
    "BDIvo_0277_0000": "You're good at providing support, right\r\nKlein? Think you could back me up?",
    "BDIvo_0277_0010": "Sure thing! Oh, but you gotta keep your\r\nspeed in check or I'll never catch up.",
    "BDIvo_0277_0020": "Thanks! I'm grateful!",
    "BDIvo_0277_0030": "Didn't you hear me?!\r\nI said don't go too fast! Wait up!",
    "BDIvo_0278_0000": "Your grenade launchers sure are\r\nhandy in a fight, Fukaziroh!",
    "BDIvo_0278_0010": "That's what I like to hear!\r\nKlein, was it? Finally, someone else\r\nwho understands my appeal!",
    "BDIvo_0278_0020": "You sure sound like the kind of person\r\nI want on my side! Wait! Whoa, stop!\r\nDon't shoot! Aaaaah!",
    "BDIvo_0279_0000": "You have interesting tastes.\r\nI noticed the Japanese influences\r\nin your character design.",
    "BDIvo_0279_0010": "Oooh, you can tell?\r\nSomething real manly\r\nabout it, right?",
    "BDIvo_0279_0020": "Hee hee, a real romantic, eh?\r\nI have a similar attraction\r\nto explosions!",
    "BDIvo_0280_0000": "Looks like a tough fight ahead of us.",
    "BDIvo_0280_0010": "Indeed. We must both steel ourselves\r\nas fellow swordsmen.",
    "BDIvo_0280_0020": "You got that right.\r\nBut I'm sure we'll get through this!",
    "BDIvo_0281_0000": "Magnificent swordsmanship, Klein.",
    "BDIvo_0281_0010": "Heh, someone's got a good eye!\r\nJust you watch, I'm gonna show you\r\njust how cool I am!",
    "BDIvo_0281_0020": "A battlefield is no place to get\r\ncarried away. Stay sharp.",
    "BDIvo_0282_0000": "Hey there, Eugeo! You're almost as\r\nstrong as me, so I expect some nice\r\nsword fighting out there, you hear?",
    "BDIvo_0282_0010": "Thank you! I respect your swift\r\nswordsmanship as well!",
    "BDIvo_0282_0020": "Huh? Oh, uh...\r\nY-Yeah, thanks! Follow me!",
    "BDIvo_0283_0000": "So you're also trained in the\r\nAincrad Style, Klein?",
    "BDIvo_0283_0010": "You know it! Just come to Master Klein\r\nif you wanna know the soul of the\r\nAincrad Style!",
    "BDIvo_0283_0020": "Master Klein? Okay! Sounds great!\r\nTeach me all you know, Master Klein!",
    "BDIvo_0284_0000": "Oh, if it isn't Heathcliff.\r\nI know I can count on you.\r\nSo long as you're on my side, that is.",
    "BDIvo_0284_0010": "Are you certain you should be putting\r\nall that faith in me? Relying on someone\r\nelse's strength is a risky proposition.",
    "BDIvo_0284_0020": "Whoa!\r\nA-aren't ya supposed to be on my side?!",
    "BDIvo_0285_0000": "Klein, I need you to rout the enemies\r\nto create a path for our survival.",
    "BDIvo_0285_0010": "You got it! Just sit back and I'll mow\r\nthese enemies down in no time!",
    "BDIvo_0285_0020": "Your ardor is inspiring,\r\nbut do be careful.",
    "BDIvo_0286_0000": "Can't believe I'm actually teaming up\r\nwith Red-Eyed XaXa.",
    "BDIvo_0286_0010": "Klein from the frontlines, was it?\r\nYou and your Fuurinkazan guild\r\nwere all bark and no bite.",
    "BDIvo_0286_0020": "Ooh, those are fighting words.\r\nBut I'll let it slide for now.\r\nWe're fighting together, like it or not.",
    "BDIvo_0287_0000": "Klein of Fuurinkazan.\r\nI will shoot you if you\r\ntake one slow step.",
    "BDIvo_0287_0010": "Just who do you think you're talking to?\r\nYou won't get a second to shine with\r\nthe Great Klein around!",
    "BDIvo_0287_0020": "You annoy me. But I suppose\r\nyou will suffice as bait.",
    "BDIvo_0288_0000": "Hey! You're Yuna the Diva, right?!\r\nI can't believe it's really you!",
    "BDIvo_0288_0010": "Yep, I'm the one and only Yuna!\r\nToday, I'm here to cheer you on!",
    "BDIvo_0288_0020": "For real?! You haven't even sung a bar\r\nand already I feel a rush of energy!",
    "BDIvo_0289_0000": "Klein, the fight's getting started!\r\nEverything set for the concert?",
    "BDIvo_0289_0010": "Yeah, I've got it all covered!\r\nThere aren't any glow sticks though!",
    "BDIvo_0289_0020": "Then you'll just have to light the\r\nplace up with some flashy abilities!\r\nLet's rock!",
    "BDIvo_0290_0000": "Hey, Eiji! Just so you know, I'm not\r\njealous you're so tight with Yuna. Not\r\na bit!",
    "BDIvo_0290_0010": "Isn't it best if you're not?",
    "BDIvo_0290_0020": "Hey now! Are you making fun of me?\r\nYou're mocking me, aren't you?!",
    "BDIvo_0291_0000": "Hey, Eiji!\r\nDon't go stabbin' me in the back, okay?!",
    "BDIvo_0291_0010": "I'd never do anything like that.\r\nIt wouldn't make sense with our\r\nobjectives aligned.",
    "BDIvo_0291_0020": "Good enough for me!\r\nLet's get in the game!",
    "BDIvo_0292_0000": "Y-You! You're...\r\nUh, who are you again?",
    "BDIvo_0292_0010": "Insolent wretch!\r\nI am the exalted Fairy King!",
    "BDIvo_0292_0020": "Huh? Seriously? Looks to me\r\nlike a stiff breeze could knock\r\nyou down. You been eating?",
    "BDIvo_0293_0000": "I shall bestow you with the honor of\r\nserving as my shield, Klein.",
    "BDIvo_0293_0010": "I'm sorry, what?\r\nWho would want that job?",
    "BDIvo_0293_0020": "Peons have no place defying their king.\r\nGo forth. I shall lead from the back.",
    "BDIvo_0294_0000": "Wow, never thought I'd get\r\nto fight with you, Quinella!\r\nI swear I'll keep you safe!",
    "BDIvo_0294_0010": "My, such valor. I may anoint you as one\r\nof my knights should you prove worthy.",
    "BDIvo_0294_0020": "Really?! I better get the lead out!\r\nHey, pipsqueak! Come get some!",
    "BDIvo_0295_0000": "I shall grant you the glory of\r\nacting as my sword.",
    "BDIvo_0295_0010": "Y-You mean that?! Woohoo!\r\nI feel amped up already!",
    "BDIvo_0295_0020": "Why am I suddenly reminded of Chudelkin?",
    "BDIvo_0296_0000": "Oh hey, if it ain't Yui.\r\nDon't hurt yourself!",
    "BDIvo_0296_0010": "I won't.\r\nBut will you help me when I need it?",
    "BDIvo_0296_0020": "Of course! I'm a nice guy!\r\nThat's what I do!",
    "BDIvo_0297_0000": "Your outfit's so cool, Klein!",
    "BDIvo_0297_0010": "Heh, right? Fine feathers make fine\r\nbirds! Aren't I just cool?",
    "BDIvo_0297_0020": "I'm not sure if that's what it means,\r\nbut as long as you're happy.",
    "BDIvo_0298_0000": "Hey there, LLENN. Got enough equipment?",
    "BDIvo_0298_0010": "Yep, I'm good for now. Are you trying to\r\nexpand your client base or something?",
    "BDIvo_0298_0020": "You bet! I hope to see your face\r\nin my shop a whole lot more.",
    "BDIvo_0299_0000": "Whoa, your avatar's so big and buff!",
    "BDIvo_0299_0010": "Eh, it's just how I look IRL.",
    "BDIvo_0299_0020": "Wait, really? So you're actually that tall? Heh, we have more in common than I thought!",
    "BDIvo_0300_0000": "You sure bring a toybox of firepower\r\nto the party, Fukaziroh. Thanks.",
    "BDIvo_0300_0010": "Hah! Feel free to compliment me more!",
    "BDIvo_0300_0020": "Would be nice if you didn't burn\r\nabsolutely everything, though.\r\nAt least leave us a way out, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0301_0000": "Hey Agil, you deal\r\nin bullets and bombs?",
    "BDIvo_0301_0010": "Mmm, sorry, I don't think I've got\r\nanything you're looking for.",
    "BDIvo_0301_0020": "Aw, that sucks!\r\nAnd here I was hoping I'd find me\r\na stash of unlimited grenades!",
    "BDIvo_0302_0000": "Take a load off, would you, Alice?\r\nYou must be beat.",
    "BDIvo_0302_0010": "Are you asking me to lower my guard?\r\nDo you not realize that an enemy could\r\nstrike at any moment?",
    "BDIvo_0302_0020": "No, I'm just saying\r\nyou're too high strung is all!\r\nTry to have a little fun, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0303_0000": "It is reassuring to have you fighting\r\nby my side, Agil.",
    "BDIvo_0303_0010": "Well, I'm not the party's tank for\r\nnothing. I'll defend you from any foe\r\nthat comes our way.",
    "BDIvo_0303_0020": "I admire your valor!\r\nI shall aid you in vanquishing our\r\nenemies in one fell stroke!",
    "BDIvo_0304_0000": "Awesome sword skills, Eugeo!",
    "BDIvo_0304_0010": "Kirito taught me.\r\nI'm still trying to measure up to him.",
    "BDIvo_0304_0020": "Nah, I'm sure you could beat him!\r\nI always look forward to\r\nseeing you fight!",
    "BDIvo_0305_0000": "I can always count on you to slice\r\nand dice our enemies, Agil!",
    "BDIvo_0305_0010": "Haha! I appreciate you saying that!\r\nJust for that, I'm gonna really get\r\nin there this time!",
    "BDIvo_0305_0020": "Seriously, it's hard to believe you're\r\na merchant with that degree of menace.",
    "BDIvo_0306_0000": "Well, if it ain't Heathcliff.\r\nI'm sure you have some strategies to\r\nhelp the team work together.",
    "BDIvo_0306_0010": "Hmm. I have faith in your skill,\r\nso I'm sure we'll be able to attack\r\ncomfortably in tandem.",
    "BDIvo_0306_0020": "Heck yeah! That sounds great!",
    "BDIvo_0307_0000": "I have heard that greed has guided your\r\nhand as a merchant at times, Agil.",
    "BDIvo_0307_0010": "That was in order to support the mid-level—Uh, never mind. Dang you,\r\nKirito! Why does he have to go blabbin'?",
    "BDIvo_0307_0020": "Heh, I understand how you feel.",
    "BDIvo_0307_0030": "I surmise you are trustworthy based on\r\nyour actions.",
    "BDIvo_0308_0000": "Don't go shooting me in the back,\r\nDeath Gun.",
    "BDIvo_0308_0010": "Ridiculous. You don't interest me.",
    "BDIvo_0308_0020": "Look, I know you're on our side for now,\r\nbut I'll end you if you pull any sneaky\r\nbusiness.",
    "BDIvo_0309_0000": "So you're a tank?\r\nSlow me down and you get shot.",
    "BDIvo_0309_0010": "Ugh, you're lucky you're on our side\r\ntoday. Much as I can't stand you,\r\nI'll still defend you.",
    "BDIvo_0309_0020": "Heh heh. That's right. Be a good shield.",
    "BDIvo_0310_0000": "Never would've thought I'd be fighting\r\nalongside a diva. I can't screw this up.",
    "BDIvo_0310_0010": "Don't sweat it! A little screw up\r\nisn't the end of the world!\r\nStay cheery and let's go!",
    "BDIvo_0310_0020": "Haha! Thanks for saying that. I feel\r\nbetter. You really are a great diva!",
    "BDIvo_0311_0000": "Do you sell glowsticks and mics, Agil?",
    "BDIvo_0311_0010": "Me? Nope. How could either\r\nof those help someone survive?",
    "BDIvo_0311_0020": "Mics make me stronger\r\nand let me boost everyone!\r\nI hope you'll get some in stock!",
    "BDIvo_0312_0000": "Look Eiji, I get you're strong and all,\r\nbut don't get reckless, all right?",
    "BDIvo_0312_0010": "I don't know what you're so worried\r\nabout, but I'll only do what I must.",
    "BDIvo_0312_0020": "Heh, well, I know I can trust your\r\nskill. Let's kick some butt together!",
    "BDIvo_0313_0000": "Are you a tank?",
    "BDIvo_0313_0010": "Sure am. I'll draw enemy fire, so you\r\nplunge ahead and don't worry about a\r\nthing.",
    "BDIvo_0313_0020": "I don't care what happens to me.\r\nJust keep Yuna safe.",
    "BDIvo_0314_0000": "So you're Oberon, the Fairy King?\r\nGuess we're fighting together this time.",
    "BDIvo_0314_0010": "What's this? A golem with free will?\r\nYou look like you'll come in handy.",
    "BDIvo_0314_0020": "Who're you callin' a golem? Screw you,\r\nman! I don't take orders from you!",
    "BDIvo_0315_0000": "I grant you the right to slay my enemies\r\nas my right hand.\r\nYou should be honored, Agil.",
    "BDIvo_0315_0010": "You wanna talk honor? Stop being a wuss\r\nand fight your own battles!",
    "BDIvo_0315_0020": "P-Perish the thought!\r\nGrr... impertinent subjects!\r\nHow many of you will defy your king?!",
    "BDIvo_0316_0000": "Quinella, right? Word has it\r\nyou're quite the powerhouse.",
    "BDIvo_0316_0010": "Hmph, quite an attitude on this one.\r\nPerhaps I should relieve you\r\nof your memories?",
    "BDIvo_0316_0020": "Whoa, hey, hold it, sorry! Whew...\r\nIs she seriously on our side?",
    "BDIvo_0317_0000": "Hmm. Your appearance does not\r\nbetray you. You are indeed strong.",
    "BDIvo_0317_0010": "Well, yeah! Can't protect your\r\nfriends without muscles, right?",
    "BDIvo_0317_0020": "I see. So your sense of justice is\r\nequally as formidable.\r\nYou would make a fine Integrity Knight.",
    "BDIvo_0318_0000": "Glad I get to fight with you, Yui.",
    "BDIvo_0318_0010": "Me too! I'll do all I can to \r\nnot get in your way!",
    "BDIvo_0318_0020": "Ha ha ha, no need to be so tense!\r\nLet's do our best and have some fun.",
    "BDIvo_0319_0000": "I'd sure love to try that ginger ale\r\nMommy and Daddy are always\r\nhaving at your bar!",
    "BDIvo_0319_0010": "The ginger ale I serve is for adults,\r\nyou know.",
    "BDIvo_0319_0020": "Wait, really? Phooey. Then I guess\r\nI'll just stick with hot milk.",
    "BDIvo_0320_0000": "Stay sharp, Fuka!",
    "BDIvo_0320_0010": "You got it! I'm all over this, partner!",
    "BDIvo_0320_0020": "Let's get this over with and fast!",
    "BDIvo_0321_0000": "Heya, Kohi. You giving Little Miss P\r\nall the love she deserves?",
    "BDIvo_0321_0010": "Of course! And don't forget about\r\nLittle Miss Kni and Vorp, either!",
    "BDIvo_0321_0020": "Ugh, still playing the doting parent,\r\nare ya? Rightony, Leftania! See that?\r\nThat's how not to be!",
    "BDIvo_0322_0000": "Let's do this, Alice!",
    "BDIvo_0322_0010": "The strength that tiny frame\r\nof yours conceals stuns me.\r\nLet's both strive to fight our best.",
    "BDIvo_0322_0020": "Eheh heh, you got it! Hearing you call\r\nme tiny fires me up for some reason!",
    "BDIvo_0323_0000": "LLENN!\r\nGet the drop on those enemies!",
    "BDIvo_0323_0010": "Roger that! Back me up once I've\r\nfilled them with lead! Raaagh!",
    "BDIvo_0323_0020": "Do be careful not to go off on your\r\nown—Sh-She's gone already?!",
    "BDIvo_0324_0000": "Eugeo! Please watch your attacks!\r\nI'm not well built for arctic climates!",
    "BDIvo_0324_0010": "Huh? I don't know what you mean,\r\nbut I'll back you up!",
    "BDIvo_0324_0020": "(I don't think he got it.) Okay!\r\nI'll watch where I'm stepping!",
    "BDIvo_0325_0000": "I'll have to be careful not to freeze\r\nthe ground with you around, LLENN.",
    "BDIvo_0325_0010": "Wait a sec! I know! Maybe I can go\r\nfaster if I try skating across it!",
    "BDIvo_0325_0020": "Ahaha, that could be fun!",
    "BDIvo_0326_0000": "*gulp* You're Heathcliff.\r\nThe one behind the SAO Incident.",
    "BDIvo_0326_0010": "Oh? So you're LLENN, are you?\r\nNever fear. I am not your enemy.",
    "BDIvo_0326_0020": "Th-That makes me feel a lot better!\r\nOkay then, glad to meet you!",
    "BDIvo_0327_0000": "LLENN, judging from your playstyle,\r\nI think you'd serve us better as a ranger.",
    "BDIvo_0327_0010": "That was the plan all along! You can\r\ncount on me to shoot right through 'em!",
    "BDIvo_0327_0020": "That's reassuring. I'll be expecting\r\ngreat things from you.",
    "BDIvo_0328_0000": "Huh? Death Gun?! You're that guy who—\r\nOh my gosh, I'm soooooo dead.",
    "BDIvo_0328_0010": "I've heard of you.\r\nAren't you the Pink Devil?",
    "BDIvo_0328_0020": "That makes us the same.",
    "BDIvo_0328_0030": "No way! We're nothing alike!",
    "BDIvo_0329_0000": "An AGI-maxed machine gunner?\r\nI guess you'll make a good decoy.",
    "BDIvo_0329_0010": "And you're a sniper, huh?\r\nWe'll be a great team!",
    "BDIvo_0329_0020": "Teamwork? Hmph.\r\nDo what you will.\r\nBut do be useful.",
    "BDIvo_0330_0000": "Wow, I can't believe I'm actually\r\nacquaintances with an idol.",
    "BDIvo_0330_0010": "Heh heh! You'll make me a happy camper\r\nif I make a fan out of you!",
    "BDIvo_0330_0020": "Y-You're so sweet!\r\nUnlike a certain other singer I know.",
    "BDIvo_0331_0000": "Are my songs any help to you, LLENN?",
    "BDIvo_0331_0010": "Of course! Your singing makes me feel\r\nlike I can really go the distance!",
    "BDIvo_0331_0020": "Woohoo! Away we go!",
    "BDIvo_0331_0030": "Whoa, you're so fast!\r\nI lost track of you instantly!",
    "BDIvo_0332_0000": "Um, so Eiji, you're like a member of\r\nYuna's agency, right?",
    "BDIvo_0332_0010": "It's more complicated than that.\r\nWe're... friends, I guess?\r\nIt's hard to find the right word.",
    "BDIvo_0332_0020": "Oh. And here I thought the two of you\r\nmight be like Pito and M.",
    "BDIvo_0332_0030": "Guess not.",
    "BDIvo_0333_0000": "I heard you know a singer too.",
    "BDIvo_0333_0010": "Yep. But unlike Yuna, she's a nu—\r\nActually, forget I said anything!",
    "BDIvo_0333_0020": "Sounds like you've had some\r\nrough times of your own.",
    "BDIvo_0334_0000": "He seems so confident in himself,\r\nbut can he actually fight?",
    "BDIvo_0334_0010": "Hey, you're talking about me, aren't\r\nyou? Well, don't underestimate the\r\npower of a king!",
    "BDIvo_0334_0020": "A king? Does that mean you'll\r\ngive me a reward or something?\r\nThat's quite encouraging!",
    "BDIvo_0335_0000": "Hey, you. Yes, you, the pink shrimp.\r\nAll that jittering is getting annoying!\r\nStand still!",
    "BDIvo_0335_0010": "Sh-Shrimp?!\r\nDid you just call me a shrimp?!",
    "BDIvo_0335_0020": "Heh, I just call them like I see—Wait,\r\nwhy do you suddenly seem so happy?!",
    "BDIvo_0335_0030": "Yay! I got called a shrimp!\r\nIt rocks being small!",
    "BDIvo_0336_0000": "Just how tough are you, Quinella?",
    "BDIvo_0336_0010": "If you ask me, you seem too elegant\r\nfor the battlefield.",
    "BDIvo_0336_0020": "Heh heh. I fail to see how that will\r\nbe an issue so long as you defend me.",
    "BDIvo_0336_0030": "Th-That just gave me the chills.\r\nDunno why, but I think I need to watch\r\nmy back.",
    "BDIvo_0337_0000": "Your weaponry is quite intriguing,\r\nLLENN.",
    "BDIvo_0337_0010": "I know, right? My little girl doesn't\r\njust shred the enemy, I can also use\r\nher as a shield and to whack things!",
    "BDIvo_0337_0020": "My, that is certainly versatile.\r\nI'm sure it will keep me safe.",
    "BDIvo_0338_0000": "Wow, so you can fight even though\r\nyou're a navigation pixie, Yui?",
    "BDIvo_0338_0010": "Oh, yes! I may be small, but I'll do\r\nall that I can to help the others!",
    "BDIvo_0338_0020": "You said it! With cuteness and tininess\r\ncomes great justice!",
    "BDIvo_0339_0000": "So LLENN, you're from GGO, right?\r\nI've never been there before!",
    "BDIvo_0339_0010": "Yeah. Having navigation pixies in that\r\ngame would break it so hard it wouldn't\r\neven be fair.",
    "BDIvo_0339_0020": "What? B-But I don't endorse cheating!\r\nYou have to believe me!",
    "BDIvo_0340_0000": "Ha! Look at that! Another field ready\r\nto be reduced to ashes by the\r\nGreat Fukaziroh's grenades!",
    "BDIvo_0340_0010": "Your attacks are far too bombastic.\r\nBut if you went in first,\r\nyou'd avoid friendly fire.",
    "BDIvo_0340_0020": "Ooh, that's a nice idea, Alice!\r\nI'll go and blow 'em to kingdom come\r\nbefore they know what hit 'em!",
    "BDIvo_0341_0000": "You rely far too much on firepower,\r\nFukaziroh. Why not take some time to\r\nconcoct a strategy first?",
    "BDIvo_0341_0010": "Hey! I'll have you know I do plan\r\nthings, thank you very much!\r\nTo the smallest detail!",
    "BDIvo_0341_0020": "Is that so? Then do elaborate.\r\nWhat sort of strategy have you in mind?",
    "BDIvo_0341_0030": "Shoot anything that moves! I call it the\r\n\"Kill First, Ask Questions Later\" strategy!",
    "BDIvo_0342_0000": "Hey Eugeo, can you do that\r\nfreezing thingy right now?",
    "BDIvo_0342_0010": "Certainly, but why?\r\nThere are no beasts around.",
    "BDIvo_0342_0020": "Hehehe! I was thinking of making\r\nsnow cones, that's why!",
    "BDIvo_0343_0000": "It's hard to believe, but with your\r\nexplosions and my Sacred Arts,\r\nwe might make a good match!",
    "BDIvo_0343_0010": "Oh? Are you asking me on a date? Hold on\r\na sec, gotta adjust my schedule first.",
    "BDIvo_0343_0020": "Huh? What are you talking about?!",
    "BDIvo_0344_0000": "Hey there, Heathcliff!\r\nIf you want to see how it's done,\r\njust watch me!",
    "BDIvo_0344_0010": "I believe in your abilities, but that\r\nbeing said, do be careful not to get\r\ncarried away.",
    "BDIvo_0344_0020": "Aha! Not sure exactly what you're\r\nimplying, but I'll watch myself!",
    "BDIvo_0345_0000": "Aw yeah! Let's take 'em down!",
    "BDIvo_0345_0010": "Extreme power is a double-edged sword,\r\nFukaziroh. Exercise caution so that it\r\ndoes not control you.",
    "BDIvo_0345_0020": "Yeah, yeah, I know! Hmm.\r\nGuess I'd better keep the plasma\r\ngrenades in reserve instead.",
    "BDIvo_0346_0000": "Holy crap! It's the real Death Gun!",
    "BDIvo_0346_0010": "Who are you? Do you mock me?\r\nYou must be a suicidal fool.",
    "BDIvo_0346_0020": "Whoa, that's some serious bloodlust\r\nyou've got! We're on the same side,\r\nso please don't kill me!",
    "BDIvo_0347_0000": "Your grenades block my shots.\r\nWatch your timing.",
    "BDIvo_0347_0010": "You got it, Mr. Death Gun sir!\r\nI'll be sure to fire when\r\nit'll be most exciting!",
    "BDIvo_0347_0020": "Gah! You'll be shot if you\r\nmake me miss again.",
    "BDIvo_0348_0000": "Wow, it's the Diva! If you need someone\r\nto head up the fanclub, I'm your girl!",
    "BDIvo_0348_0010": "Thanks, Fuka!\r\nThen I'll make sure to sing something\r\nthat'll rock your socks off!",
    "BDIvo_0348_0020": "Aw yeah! I'll shout until\r\nmy throat's dry as a desert!",
    "BDIvo_0349_0000": "Could you help me with the pyrotechnics\r\nfor my concert, Fukaziroh?",
    "BDIvo_0349_0010": "Heh heh, so you know talent when you\r\nsee it, eh? I'll give you the flashiest\r\nconcert the world has ever seen!",
    "BDIvo_0349_0020": "Woohoo! Then let's go out there and\r\nput on the performance of a lifetime!",
    "BDIvo_0350_0000": "Hey there, Eiji!\r\nWhat's with the glum face?",
    "BDIvo_0350_0010": "What are you talking about?\r\nThis is how I always look.",
    "BDIvo_0350_0020": "Aha ha, whoops, sorry!\r\nAnyway, just come to good old Fukaziroh\r\nif you need any help!",
    "BDIvo_0351_0000": "Your attacks are way too flashy.\r\nI'm worried you'll blow us up before\r\nyou even land a hit on the enemy.",
    "BDIvo_0351_0010": "Huh? Really? Okay, then I'll switch to\r\nthese super cool plasma grenades\r\ninstead!",
    "BDIvo_0351_0020": "You're not listening, are you?",
    "BDIvo_0352_0000": "Hey, Mister! Get outta the way\r\nor you'll be blown to smithereens!",
    "BDIvo_0352_0010": "How dare you be so impertinent to a\r\nking! You shall fight at the front as\r\npunishment!",
    "BDIvo_0352_0020": "What an annoying excuse for\r\na king! Follow me, that is if you're\r\nokay with getting burned.",
    "BDIvo_0353_0000": "Fukaziroh, was it?\r\nYou are a threat to everyone with all\r\nthose bombs you carry around!",
    "BDIvo_0353_0010": "Hmph, amateur. Sure, these grenade\r\nlaunchers are dangerous and hard to\r\nhandle, but I know what I'm doing!",
    "BDIvo_0353_0020": "C'mon!\r\nI'll prove it to you with one shot!",
    "BDIvo_0353_0030": "Don't pull the trigger without warning!\r\nStay away from me!",
    "BDIvo_0354_0000": "Watch yourself, Quinella.\r\nIt's dangerous to get too close to me.",
    "BDIvo_0354_0010": "You're warning me of all people?\r\nI cannot tell whether that comes from\r\narrogance or confidence.",
    "BDIvo_0354_0020": "No, it's just, I'm missing a grenade\r\nso... Eh, whatever.\r\nGuess it doesn't matter.",
    "BDIvo_0354_0030": "It most certainly does!\r\nFind it! Now!",
    "BDIvo_0355_0000": "Are you confident enough to think\r\nyou can defend me, Fukaziroh?",
    "BDIvo_0355_0010": "Uh, sure? You can count on me!\r\nThe Great Fukaziroh can make anything go boom!",
    "BDIvo_0355_0020": "What a peculiar girl.\r\nThough doubtlessly capable,\r\nher presence discomforts me.",
    "BDIvo_0356_0000": "Hey Yui. We make such a cute and\r\ntiny team, maybe we'll catch our \r\nenemies off guard!",
    "BDIvo_0356_0010": "Perhaps. But size doesn't always\r\nindicate strength!",
    "BDIvo_0356_0020": "You said it! I may be small,\r\nbut I've got my launchers,\r\nand I'm not afraid to use 'em!",
    "BDIvo_0357_0000": "Please cover the rear, Fukaziroh!",
    "BDIvo_0357_0010": "You got it!\r\nDo you prefer fireworks or bedlam?",
    "BDIvo_0357_0020": "U-Um, anything as long as\r\nit isn't too spicy.",
    "BDIvo_0358_0000": "I trust you to take the lead, Eugeo.\r\nI'll cover you.",
    "BDIvo_0358_0010": "Thanks, Alice.",
    "BDIvo_0358_0020": "If you're watching, it's even more\r\nreason to give it my all!",
    "BDIvo_0358_0030": "I look forward to you making good on\r\nthose words. Now let us go forth!",
    "BDIvo_0359_0000": "I'll defend you, Alice!",
    "BDIvo_0359_0010": "Defend? It would appear that you are\r\nmaking light of me. In which case,\r\nI shall defend you myself.",
    "BDIvo_0359_0020": "There isn't a single opponent who can\r\ntake the two of us together! Let's go!",
    "BDIvo_0360_0000": "Are you ready for combat, Heathcliff?",
    "BDIvo_0360_0010": "Of course. I shall spare no effort.",
    "BDIvo_0360_0020": "I look forward to fighting\r\nside-by-side with a fellow knight.",
    "BDIvo_0361_0000": "I know you are capable, Alice.\r\nTake point.",
    "BDIvo_0361_0010": "Very well, if I must. I will likewise\r\nbe counting on you for support.",
    "BDIvo_0361_0020": "Yes, of course. I shall do all I can.",
    "BDIvo_0362_0000": "You are far too solitary.\r\nI ask you put some effort into\r\ncooperating with everyone.",
    "BDIvo_0362_0010": "Worried for me, are you?\r\nAmusing. I can manage.\r\nYou all are the weaklings.",
    "BDIvo_0362_0020": "Someday you'll understand the power in\r\ntaking aid from those who care for you.",
    "BDIvo_0363_0000": "Look how confident you are.\r\nYou've got no clue what real power is.",
    "BDIvo_0363_0010": "And I suppose you believe you do?\r\nAmusing. Prove it then, if you can.",
    "BDIvo_0363_0020": "Heh heh heh, as you wish. Stand back\r\nand watch as I display my superiority.",
    "BDIvo_0364_0000": "Hearing you sing draws forth a\r\nwellspring of power from deep within me.",
    "BDIvo_0364_0010": "I bet you'd pump everyone\r\nelse up if you sang yourself.\r\nWhat say we sing together?",
    "BDIvo_0364_0020": "Huh? U-Uh, I, um... I-I'm a knight,\r\nso I must focus on fighting instead!",
    "BDIvo_0365_0000": "So, you've never heard\r\nme sing before, Alice?",
    "BDIvo_0365_0010": "No. However, I have heard that your singing encouraged many a warrior during the Underworld War.",
    "BDIvo_0365_0020": "I only managed that\r\nbecause Eiji was with me.",
    "BDIvo_0365_0030": "But I'd sure like to put on a concert\r\nin your world the next chance I get!",
    "BDIvo_0366_0000": "I heard you were of great assistance in the Underworld War.\r\nYou have my gratitude.",
    "BDIvo_0366_0010": "Thank Yuna, not me.",
    "BDIvo_0366_0020": "I couldn't have done anything\r\nwithout her singing.",
    "BDIvo_0366_0030": "Heh, how interesting. Yuna said\r\nsomething much along the same lines.",
    "BDIvo_0367_0000": "You use sword skills\r\nakin to Kirito's, yes?",
    "BDIvo_0367_0010": "Sure, though I doubt I'd be\r\nmuch of a match for him.",
    "BDIvo_0367_0020": "Don't say that. I can tell you're more\r\nthan handy with a sword. Give me the\r\nopportunity to test you later.",
    "BDIvo_0368_0000": "Hiding from the enemy, are we?\r\nSome things never change, Oberon.",
    "BDIvo_0368_0010": "A king needn't fight his own battles.\r\nThat is what subjects are for.",
    "BDIvo_0368_0020": "Well, then. I am no servant of yours,\r\nso I shall leave the nearby enemies to\r\nyou, yes?",
    "BDIvo_0369_0000": "Oh, if it isn't Alice. There's a beast\r\nI suppose I better not prod.",
    "BDIvo_0369_0010": "I could swear I just heard\r\nslander against me.",
    "BDIvo_0369_0020": "Now wait a minute!\r\nNo such deed was committed!",
    "BDIvo_0369_0030": "Oh look, enemies! Eeek!",
    "BDIvo_0370_0000": "Lady Pontifex! Never have I imagined\r\nfighting by your side in such a fashion.",
    "BDIvo_0370_0010": "Heh heh, oh Alice, what a unique\r\nIntegrity Knight you are.",
    "BDIvo_0370_0020": "Defend me, would you?",
    "BDIvo_0370_0030": "I will do what I must. For though we\r\nonce were on opposite sides, the two\r\nof us now find ourselves allied.",
    "BDIvo_0371_0000": "Your countenance has gained\r\na modicum of softness.\r\nI suppose that boy is to thank?",
    "BDIvo_0371_0010": "Please focus on the battle at hand.\r\nWe can discuss Kirito later.",
    "BDIvo_0371_0020": "I never said I was talking about Kirito.\r\nHeh! It would appear I hit the nail\r\nright on the head.",
    "BDIvo_0372_0000": "Please don't push yourself, Yui.\r\nKirito would grieve if anything\r\nwere to happen to you.",
    "BDIvo_0372_0010": "Okay. But I'm not just going\r\nto sit back and let you protect me\r\nthe whole time, all right?",
    "BDIvo_0372_0020": "I'll be backing you up!",
    "BDIvo_0372_0030": "I see. My apologies.\r\nThen let us go and fight as one!",
    "BDIvo_0373_0000": "Let me back you up, Alice!",
    "BDIvo_0373_0010": "Much appreciated. I sense your\r\nassistance will make battle easier.",
    "BDIvo_0373_0020": "It will, I promise!\r\nLet's both do our best out there!",
    "BDIvo_0374_0000": "Kirito told me that you're the\r\noriginator of the Aincrad Style.",
    "BDIvo_0374_0010": "Hmm, originator, eh? I suppose that term\r\nmay bear some accuracy.",
    "BDIvo_0374_0020": "Please duel me once this battle is over!",
    "BDIvo_0375_0000": "It is quite moving to see you with\r\nmy own eyes, Eugeo.",
    "BDIvo_0375_0010": "Huh? What do you mean?",
    "BDIvo_0375_0020": "Pardon me. Forget I said anything. To\r\nthink... they developed such a powerful\r\nsense of self after all this time.",
    "BDIvo_0376_0000": "So you're Death Gun, huh?\r\nI heard you tried to kill Kirito once.",
    "BDIvo_0376_0010": "Not just once. I'll shoot him\r\nif the opportunity arises.\r\nYou watch your back too.",
    "BDIvo_0376_0020": "Neither of us will go down that easily.\r\nBut let us set that aside.\r\nWe're comrades for the time being.",
    "BDIvo_0377_0000": "I saw you freeze everything.\r\nWhat a bizarre skill you have.",
    "BDIvo_0377_0010": "Oh, you mean my Release Recollection?",
    "BDIvo_0377_0020": "It may be useful to me, so, as much as\r\nyou annoy me, I'll help you. For now.",
    "BDIvo_0378_0000": "Your singing is always such a big help.\r\nIs there anything I can do to thank you?",
    "BDIvo_0378_0010": "I'm happy just to sing for you!\r\nOh! I will accept a tasty treat, though!",
    "BDIvo_0378_0020": "In that case, I'll treat you to\r\na steamed bun from my world!\r\nThey're the best!",
    "BDIvo_0378_0030": "Hope you like it!",
    "BDIvo_0379_0000": "Do you like my songs, Eugeo?",
    "BDIvo_0379_0010": "Oh yes, very much. I'd sure love it\r\nif you could sing in my world too.",
    "BDIvo_0379_0020": "Okay! Just sit tight, and I promise\r\nI'll perform a concert there someday!",
    "BDIvo_0380_0000": "I'm glad I get to fight alongside\r\nanother user of the Aincrad Style\r\nbesides Kirito.",
    "BDIvo_0380_0010": "I could never measure up to him.\r\nStill, I'll do what I must.",
    "BDIvo_0380_0020": "Really? You look pretty great with a\r\nsword from what I can tell. In any case,\r\nlet's both fight hard, Eiji!",
    "BDIvo_0381_0000": "You have a superb grasp of sword skills\r\nfor someone who never went through SAO.",
    "BDIvo_0381_0010": "Oh, Kirito trained me\r\nin the Aincrad Style.",
    "BDIvo_0381_0020": "Guy's still always\r\nlooking out for others...",
    "BDIvo_0382_0000": "Let's fight together, Fairy King!",
    "BDIvo_0382_0010": "Together? Please.\r\nYou will be defending me.",
    "BDIvo_0382_0020": "What? Me, protect you? You certainly\r\ndon't fit the image of a typical king.",
    "BDIvo_0383_0000": "What a grand sword you have.\r\nFit for a noble king such as myself,\r\nwouldn't you agree?",
    "BDIvo_0383_0010": "You mean the Blue Rose Sword?\r\nWould you like to hold it for a moment?",
    "BDIvo_0383_0020": "What?! Why's it so heavy?! Hmph, it\r\nwould seem you would be better off\r\nusing it to aid me after all.",
    "BDIvo_0384_0000": "I never thought\r\nI'd be allied with you...",
    "BDIvo_0384_0010": "My, such blatant hostility, Eugeo.",
    "BDIvo_0384_0020": "Can you blame me?\r\nStill, we are on the same side.\r\nLet's just both fulfill our duties.",
    "BDIvo_0385_0000": "Will you fight for me again, Eugeo?",
    "BDIvo_0385_0010": "I'll fight by your side,\r\nbut only because Kirito asked.",
    "BDIvo_0385_0020": "Make no mistake,\r\nI'm not fighting for you.",
    "BDIvo_0385_0030": "My my, you're no fun at all.\r\nShall I take your memories once again?",
    "BDIvo_0386_0000": "I can't believe I'm actually fighting\r\nalongside Kirito's daughter!\r\nCertainly feels odd.",
    "BDIvo_0386_0010": "I may not be as good as my daddy,\r\nbut I'll do all I can to back you up,\r\nEugeo!",
    "BDIvo_0386_0020": "Thanks. But believe me, you're just as\r\nreliable as your father! We'll do\r\ngreat!",
    "BDIvo_0387_0000": "Please fight along with me, Eugeo!",
    "BDIvo_0387_0010": "Of course, Partner! Let's show\r\neveryone that we're just as\r\ngood of a team as Kirito and I.",
    "BDIvo_0387_0020": "Partner? I love the sound of that!\r\nToday I'm Eugeo's partner!",
    "BDIvo_0388_0000": "Your adaptability certainly goes beyond\r\nthe ordinary, Death Gun. I can see that.",
    "BDIvo_0388_0010": "Heh heh, it's an honor\r\nto hear that from you.",
    "BDIvo_0388_0020": "I shall take the opportunity to\r\nobserve your combat style.\r\nIt'll serve as a valuable test case.",
    "BDIvo_0389_0000": "Heathcliff...\r\nThe source of much agony.",
    "BDIvo_0389_0010": "While I welcome your slings and\r\narrows, dealing with the enemies\r\nbefore us takes priority.",
    "BDIvo_0389_0020": "Heh heh, oh I'm grateful for what you\r\ndid. I rather liked that world.",
    "BDIvo_0390_0000": "Mmm, I know it's weird to ask after all\r\nthis time, but does singing on the\r\nbattlefield help?",
    "BDIvo_0390_0010": "Oh yes, your songs are grand. They provide\r\nboth buffs and improved concentration.",
    "BDIvo_0390_0020": "I see! Then there's nothing wrong with\r\nsinging my heart out!",
    "BDIvo_0391_0000": "As useful as your singing is,\r\nit also leaves you rather vulnerable.\r\nKeep your guard up.",
    "BDIvo_0391_0010": "Roger. But Eiji and the others\r\nkeep me safe, so I'll be fine!\r\nYou'll protect me too, won't you?",
    "BDIvo_0391_0020": "Yes, of course.\r\nI shall do all that I can.",
    "BDIvo_0392_0000": "So you overcame your own fear?\r\nI am fascinated you were able to\r\nsurpass the limits of the system.",
    "BDIvo_0392_0010": "I have a lot I'd like to say to you,\r\nbelieve me, but I'll keep it to myself\r\nfor now.",
    "BDIvo_0392_0020": "I appreciate that. Right now,\r\nwe must focus on defeating\r\nthe enemies at hand.",
    "BDIvo_0393_0000": "What's your take on the situation?",
    "BDIvo_0393_0010": "Hmm. We have too little intel to work\r\nwith to say anything for certain.",
    "BDIvo_0393_0020": "I'll take point in that case. Much as I\r\nhave mixed feelings about all this,\r\nI trust your analysis.",
    "BDIvo_0394_0000": "Sugou... No, now you go by\r\nFairy King Oberon, correct?",
    "BDIvo_0394_0010": "Hmph, is that sarcasm I\r\ndetect in your voice?",
    "BDIvo_0394_0020": "Hardly. I thought the\r\nchoice rather suited you.",
    "BDIvo_0395_0000": "Never in my wildest dreams\r\ncould I have seen myself\r\nfighting by your side, Kayaba.",
    "BDIvo_0395_0010": "Likewise.",
    "BDIvo_0395_0020": "But now that our goals align,\r\nour best option is to join forces.",
    "BDIvo_0395_0030": "Very well, Heathcliff! You would\r\ndo well to lead your brilliant\r\nclassmate into battle, then!",
    "BDIvo_0396_0000": "I find your relationship with\r\nUnderworld truly fascinating.",
    "BDIvo_0396_0010": "Hmm, you appear somewhat useful.\r\nPerhaps I should synthesize you.",
    "BDIvo_0396_0020": "Synthesis? That could make for an\r\ninteresting experience.",
    "BDIvo_0397_0000": "Heathcliff, was it? You seem rather\r\nfamiliar with the principles of this\r\nworld.",
    "BDIvo_0397_0010": "I merely know the fundamentals.\r\nNothing more.",
    "BDIvo_0397_0020": "That overwhelming modesty\r\nrubs me the wrong way.",
    "BDIvo_0398_0000": "It's rather fascinating to learn my care\r\nprogram has attained a sense of self.",
    "BDIvo_0398_0010": "You're the one who created me, right?\r\nI guess that would make you my dad\r\nfrom a programming stance.",
    "BDIvo_0398_0020": "Hold that thought. We'll have to\r\ncontinue this conversation later.\r\nIt would seem we are not alone.",
    "BDIvo_0399_0000": "Let me fight with you, Heathcliff!",
    "BDIvo_0399_0010": "Yes, of course.\r\nI'm counting on you to provide support.",
    "BDIvo_0399_0020": "Yes! I'll help as best I can!",
    "BDIvo_0400_0000": "Yuna. I despise you, but your singing\r\nis useful. Stay in the back.",
    "BDIvo_0400_0010": "Wait, are you actually worried about me?",
    "BDIvo_0400_0020": "Nope. You're just more\r\nuseful in the back.",
    "BDIvo_0401_0000": "Why are you always by yourself,\r\nDeath Gun?",
    "BDIvo_0401_0010": "Hmph. Others slow me down.",
    "BDIvo_0401_0020": "Aw, but it's much more fun to fight\r\nwith friends! I'll cheer you on!",
    "BDIvo_0401_0030": "Listen to people when\r\nthey're talking to you...",
    "BDIvo_0402_0000": "Heh heh, what's this?\r\nDid my bloodlust stop\r\nyou in your tracks?",
    "BDIvo_0402_0010": "Nah, I've felt worse.",
    "BDIvo_0402_0020": "Tch.\r\nI'll shoot you if you freeze up.\r\nKeep moving.",
    "BDIvo_0403_0000": "Red-Eyed XaXa? I guess you're\r\nall we've got to work with now.",
    "BDIvo_0403_0010": "The feeling is mutual.\r\nI'll keep a bullet for\r\nafter we're done.",
    "BDIvo_0403_0020": "Hmph. You'll be back in chains if\r\nyou try anything. Got it?",
    "BDIvo_0404_0000": "The \"Fairy King\"?\r\nRather petty considering.",
    "BDIvo_0404_0010": "Heh heh heh, do you recoil in fear of\r\nmy magnificence? It would seem even\r\nruffians such as yourself recognize it.",
    "BDIvo_0404_0020": "Heh. Hilarious.\r\nWhy don't you show me some\r\nof this \"magnificence\" right now, then?",
    "BDIvo_0405_0000": "It would seem to me that you are not\r\nwhat they call a team player, Death Gun.",
    "BDIvo_0405_0010": "You of all people would say that to me?",
    "BDIvo_0405_0020": "But know that I shall never\r\nabandon you. Now, go forth and\r\nserve your master, the Fairy King!",
    "BDIvo_0406_0000": "Quinella... You say you're tough,\r\nbut is it all just talk?",
    "BDIvo_0406_0010": "Normally, I never stoop so\r\nlow as to dirty my own hands.\r\nIt's far too much effort for my tastes.",
    "BDIvo_0406_0020": "Hmph, cocky, are we? Intriguing.\r\nWhy not show me your real strength?",
    "BDIvo_0407_0000": "Death Gun, was it? Devote yourself to my service and be my sword.",
    "BDIvo_0407_0010": "I fight for myself.\r\nI won't tolerate you hindering me.",
    "BDIvo_0407_0020": "Heh heh, perish the thought.\r\nShow me your mettle.",
    "BDIvo_0408_0000": "Hey, you. Shrimp.\r\nStop loitering or I'll shoot you.",
    "BDIvo_0408_0010": "But I just wanted to help you out.\r\nIs that not necessary?",
    "BDIvo_0408_0020": "Tch. Stay out of my way\r\nif you want to live.",
    "BDIvo_0409_0000": "Let's do all we can, Death Gun!\r\nI'll back you up all the way!",
    "BDIvo_0409_0010": "Just stay out of my way. I won't\r\ntolerate anyone who gets too\r\nclose. Friend or foe.",
    "BDIvo_0409_0020": "Okay! Then I'll back\r\nyou up from a distance!",
    "BDIvo_0410_0000": "Eiji? Are you nervous?",
    "BDIvo_0410_0010": "Me? Why would I be? No, maybe you're\r\nright. Maybe I am, a little.",
    "BDIvo_0410_0020": "I always get like this when I fight.",
    "BDIvo_0410_0030": "Hee hee. Here, take this candy\r\nand let's do our best out there.",
    "BDIvo_0411_0000": "Don't go too far ahead, Yuna. Just stay\r\nback and support me from the rear.",
    "BDIvo_0411_0010": "I hear you, but I gotta help everyone!",
    "BDIvo_0411_0020": "Much as I hate to admit it, they're all\r\nstrong, so they'll be fine without you\r\npushing yourself.",
    "BDIvo_0412_0000": "Huh? Where are you going, Oberon?",
    "BDIvo_0412_0010": "I am a king, so issuing commands from\r\nthe rear is my rightful—Hey, stop\r\nsinging! The enemy will find us!",
    "BDIvo_0412_0020": "Now now, you can't back out.\r\nLet's fight together as a team.\r\nDon't worry, I'll be cheering you on!",
    "BDIvo_0413_0000": "Yuna, you're a singer, aren't you?\r\nThen why don't I bestow upon you the\r\nglory of singing praises for a king?",
    "BDIvo_0413_0010": "Sorry, but all the tickets for\r\nmy next concert are sold out!",
    "BDIvo_0413_0020": "What?! Then when?\r\nWhen is my next\r\nopportunity?! Tell me!",
    "BDIvo_0414_0000": "What sort of songs do you like,\r\nQuinella?",
    "BDIvo_0414_0010": "Hmm. Songs glorifying me would be\r\nmy first choice.",
    "BDIvo_0414_0020": "I see. I don't know any of those, so\r\nI'll just cheer you on with one of my\r\nsingles, okay?",
    "BDIvo_0415_0000": "So you provide support merely by\r\nsinging? You simply must serve me.",
    "BDIvo_0415_0010": "I appreciate the sentiment,\r\nbut I sing for everyone! Sorry!",
    "BDIvo_0415_0020": "Heh, it would seem you fail to grasp\r\nthe glory of singing for a sole patron.",
    "BDIvo_0416_0000": "Yui! Welcome to my concert!",
    "BDIvo_0416_0010": "You're going to perform here today?",
    "BDIvo_0416_0020": "Yep, with the accompaniment\r\nof swords, magic, and guns!\r\nLet's kick this party up a notch!",
    "BDIvo_0417_0000": "Can't wait to hear your\r\nwonderful singing, Yuna!",
    "BDIvo_0417_0010": "Oh, just you wait! Hey, I know!\r\nWhy don't you sing with me?",
    "BDIvo_0417_0020": "What?! M-Me?!\r\nI-I need to start practicing now!",
    "BDIvo_0418_0000": "You're a king, right? Then why not use\r\nall that royal power of yours to take\r\nout the enemies?",
    "BDIvo_0418_0010": "Finally, someone who gets it!\r\nMwahaha, feast your eyes on\r\nthe power of the Fairy King!",
    "BDIvo_0418_0020": "Wow, I didn't think he'd be\r\nTHAT easy to manipulate.",
    "BDIvo_0419_0000": "You suffer from FullDive Non-Conformity,\r\ncorrect? I've heard that you freeze when\r\nfaced with enemies.",
    "BDIvo_0419_0010": "That guy is long gone now.\r\nDeath doesn't scare me anymore.",
    "BDIvo_0419_0020": "Perfect. I grant you the honor of serving as your king's shield!",
    "BDIvo_0420_0000": "Should you really be so calm when the\r\nenemy is right in front of us?",
    "BDIvo_0420_0010": "Heh heh, is that concern I hear?",
    "BDIvo_0420_0020": "I'll let you act as my shield\r\nif you truly insist.",
    "BDIvo_0420_0030": "Looks like I worried for nothing. Sounds\r\nlike you can manage all on your own.",
    "BDIvo_0421_0000": "Pledge your love to me, and I swear\r\nI shall return it in equal measure.",
    "BDIvo_0421_0010": "Wh-Where's this coming from?\r\nI don't need your love.",
    "BDIvo_0421_0020": "Heh heh, what a poor sport you are.\r\nIt was merely a jest.",
    "BDIvo_0421_0030": "Though I do believe Chudelkin and Klein\r\nwould be foaming at the mouth had I\r\nextended them that offer.",
    "BDIvo_0422_0000": "You helped Yuna.\r\nTime for me to repay the favor.",
    "BDIvo_0422_0010": "I'll give you a hand too! Put your faith in me!",
    "BDIvo_0422_0020": "...Yes. I will.",
    "BDIvo_0423_0000": "Eiji, let's be the best team we can\r\ntoday!",
    "BDIvo_0423_0010": "Absolutely. Fighting in sync will\r\nup the odds in our favor, after all.",
    "BDIvo_0423_0020": "Thank you so much!\r\nOkay then, let's do it!",
    "BDIvo_0424_0000": "You don't lack for self-importance.\r\nDo you not realize you are in the\r\npresence of a king?",
    "BDIvo_0424_0010": "This isn't self-importance.\r\nI AM important. How did an insect\r\nlike you end up a king?",
    "BDIvo_0424_0020": "Wh-What in the world are you?\r\nYou act more high and mighty than\r\nactual royalty!",
    "BDIvo_0425_0000": "Such impressive equipment. However, it\r\nis nothing without true skill to use it.",
    "BDIvo_0425_0010": "What did you say?!\r\nYou dare mock me?!\r\nME of all people?!",
    "BDIvo_0425_0020": "Oh? Where did you come from?\r\nI never said I was talking about you.",
    "BDIvo_0426_0000": "Well well, what do we have here? A\r\nmental care AI program? It matters not.\r\nDo all you can to be of use to me.",
    "BDIvo_0426_0010": "Okay! I'll do whatever I can!",
    "BDIvo_0426_0020": "Well, do hurry up and make yourself\r\nuseful then. You are an attendant\r\nto the king now.",
    "BDIvo_0427_0000": "Good gracious!\r\nWhat are you so worked up about?",
    "BDIvo_0427_0010": "Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to help\r\neveryone. Was I bothering you?",
    "BDIvo_0427_0020": "Hmph. You're hopeless.\r\nAll you have to worry about now is\r\nhow to best serve your king.",
    "BDIvo_0428_0000": "Yui, was it? You don't seem the type\r\nfor taking the lead.",
    "BDIvo_0428_0010": "Yep! That's right!\r\nI much prefer supporting everybody!",
    "BDIvo_0428_0020": "Is that so? Excellent. I would have\r\nyou accompany me then. I won't bite.",
    "BDIvo_0429_0000": "You're the Pontifex, aren't you,\r\nQuinella?",
    "BDIvo_0429_0010": "Indeed. I am an entity akin to a\r\ndeity, and you have earned the honor\r\nof joining those who serve me.",
    "BDIvo_0429_0020": "I should go ask Mommy and Daddy first!",

    "HDIvo_0011_0030": "Not the stories—The voices! So many different tones and individual\r\npeculiarities! It's a soothing kind of buzz!",
    "HDIvo_0011_0040": "Oh. Okay...",
    "HDIvo_0012_0000": "Enjoying the downtime, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0012_0010": "While I am not entirely used to the situation,\r\nit is reassuring to have you with me.",
    "HDIvo_0012_0020": "I'm glad to hear that.\r\nLet me know if there's anything I can do.",
    "HDIvo_0013_0000": "*yawn* I could go for a nap.",
    "HDIvo_0013_0010": "How can you think about sleep at a time like this?",
    "HDIvo_0013_0020": "It's natural to be tired after all this excitement and uncertainty.\r\nYou could rest your eyes for a moment, too.",
    "HDIvo_0013_0030": "That's so like you...\r\nI think the mood is contagious.",
    "HDIvo_0014_0000": "Man, I'm bored.",
    "HDIvo_0014_0010": "Perhaps a bit of sparring would lift your spirits?",
    "HDIvo_0014_0020": "Sure. No cheating, though.",
    "HDIvo_0015_0000": "You know, something about you being here in the cabin\r\nfeels a bit strange.",
    "HDIvo_0015_0010": "Hmph. I wouldn't be if I didn't have to. It'll be great to be rid of you all.",
    "HDIvo_0015_0020": "Don't be like that. You're a valuable ally to us now.",
    "HDIvo_0016_0000": "Hey, Yuna. How would you like to have a concert at the cabin?",
    "HDIvo_0016_0010": "I'd love to! How about something nice and low-tempo to help everyone relax?",
    "HDIvo_0016_0020": "That might put me to sleep at this point.",
    "HDIvo_0017_0000": "How did we get into this mess?",
    "HDIvo_0017_0010": "No point in crying over spilled milk.\r\nWe're better off focusing on what to do now.",
    "HDIvo_0017_0020": "I don't need you to tell me that.\r\nFor Yuna, I'll do whatever it takes.",
    "HDIvo_0018_0000": "Where is my throne, boy?",
    "HDIvo_0018_0010": "Excuse me? You're not gonna find anything like that here.",
    "HDIvo_0018_0020": "Tch. You would dare seat royalty amongst furnishings of such pathetic\r\nconstruction? How insulting.",
    "HDIvo_0019_0000": "Back in my room in the Central Cathedral, I was waited upon\r\nhand and foot. Do not disappoint me.",
    "HDIvo_0019_0010": "Whoa, whoa! Are you expecting me to be your butler? You're not getting any\r\nspecial treatment here. You'd be lucky to even get a drink.",
    "HDIvo_0019_0020": "Hehe! Pity. And here I hoped to bless you with the honor of\r\nproviding me a service.",
    "HDIvo_0020_0000": "Enjoying your downtime, Yui?",
    "HDIvo_0020_0010": "Yes, Daddy. It's so much fun having everybody around!",
    "HDIvo_0020_0020": "I thought you might be nervous around some of our scarier members,\r\nbut you seem just fine. That's my girl!",
    "HDIvo_0021_0000": "I'm in my SAO avatar, but you ended up in your GGO one.",
    "HDIvo_0021_0010": "Yeah? What's wrong with that?",
    "HDIvo_0021_0020": "I just miss your ALO avatar with the soft, fluffy tail!",
    "HDIvo_0021_0030": "Y-You don't get to touch it.",
    "HDIvo_0022_0000": "Hey Asuna, could you teach me how to cook sometime?",
    "HDIvo_0022_0010": "I'd be happy to! We can have Kirito taste test!",
    "HDIvo_0022_0020": "Sounds good! Or, we could drag him in and have a whole cooking party!",
    "HDIvo_0022_0030": "I'm sure he'd be fine with just eating. He'd probably refuse\r\nto do any cooking, though.",
    "HDIvo_0023_0000": "Sorry to bug you, Liz! Can you take a look at my sword?",
    "HDIvo_0023_0010": "Oh, brother. You overdid it again, didn't you?\r\nThey really don't call you the Berserk Healer for nothing!",
    "HDIvo_0023_0020": "You promised to stop calling me that!",
    "HDIvo_0024_0000": "Aww, Pina's all conked out! She looks so cozy!",
    "HDIvo_0024_0010": "Yeah. But her favorite nap spot is right on top of Kirito's belly!",
    "HDIvo_0024_0020": "Teehee! The thought of the two of them snoring away together is just too cute!",
    "HDIvo_0025_0000": "I'm so glad you don't have cognitive contamination anymore, Asuna.",
    "HDIvo_0025_0010": "If it wasn't for you pointing it out, I might still have it.\r\nThanks for helping me.",
    "HDIvo_0025_0020": "Aw, shucks!\r\nI'm happy to help any time!",
    "HDIvo_0025_0030": "Thanks. Same here.\r\nLet's always be there for each other!",
    "HDIvo_0026_0000": "Hey, Asu! Interested in buying some juicy info about Kii-boy?",
    "HDIvo_0026_0010": "What I'd really like to know is where exactly you're getting this\r\ninfo of yours.",
    "HDIvo_0026_0020": "Oh, a discerning customer!\r\nI could share my sources, but it's gonna cost ya!",
    "HDIvo_0027_0000": "This cabin got pretty packed, huh?",
    "HDIvo_0027_0010": "Meeting so many new people has worn me out.",
    "HDIvo_0027_0020": "Heh. Well, meeting Quinella makes up for all of it, if you ask me!",
    "HDIvo_0027_0030": "You're really not the type to get stressed out, are you, Klein?",
    "HDIvo_0028_0000": "What's the matter, Agil? You seem lost in thought.",
    "HDIvo_0028_0010": "I was just thinkin' it might be a good idea to set up shop here.",
    "HDIvo_0028_0020": "Oh? I see. Let me know when you open.\r\nI'll buy something.",
    "HDIvo_0028_0030": "Appreciated. I like having regulars.",
    "HDIvo_0029_0000": "What's with the serious face, Asuna?",
    "HDIvo_0029_0010": "I was just thinking it would be nice to have a cute little outfit like yours.",
    "HDIvo_0029_0020": "Thanks! This is my favorite! Oh, I know!\r\nWhy don't we go clothes shopping together sometime?",
    "HDIvo_0030_0000": "How're you finding the break, Fukaziroh? Enjoying yourself?",
    "HDIvo_0030_0010": "Hmm, I dunno. I feel like some snacks or maybe some ice cream\r\nwould make a big difference.",
    "HDIvo_0030_0020": "Hehe! Looks like you were able to relax after all.",
    "HDIvo_0031_0000": "It feels like my body is getting a bit stiff.",
    "HDIvo_0031_0010": "You could try sparring with someone to loosen up. You're surrounded by\r\naccomplished fighters; why not make the most of it?",
    "HDIvo_0031_0020": "You have a point. Yuuki the Absolute Sword, Heathcliff the Divine Blade,\r\nand so many others...",
    "HDIvo_0031_0030": "Don't forget Asuna the Lightning Flash!",
    "HDIvo_0032_0000": "Is this where you and Kirito live together?",
    "HDIvo_0032_0010": "Yes, it is. Though it's become more of a hangout spot for\r\neveryone lately.",
    "HDIvo_0032_0020": "I can see why. It's a lovely home.",
    "HDIvo_0033_0000": "Taking some time off, Commander?",
    "HDIvo_0033_0010": "Indeed, I am. Victory requires strength.\r\nI'm replenishing mine now in preparation for the battles ahead.",
    "HDIvo_0034_0000": "Fools, all of you.\r\nWasting time in a place like this.",
    "HDIvo_0034_0010": "Oh? You seem to be taking it just as easy as everyone else, though.",
    "HDIvo_0034_0020": "...",
    "HDIvo_0035_0000": "What is it, Yuna? Looking for something?",
    "HDIvo_0035_0010": "I was just wondering how we could remodel this cabin into an awesome venue!",
    "HDIvo_0035_0020": "D-Don't get too carried away, okay?",
    "HDIvo_0036_0000": "How's your break, Eiji?",
    "HDIvo_0036_0010": "Good enough, I suppose. It's hard to relax with certain people around.",
    "HDIvo_0036_0020": "I know how you feel, but it's important to rest.\r\nStaying on edge all the time isn't healthy.",
    "HDIvo_0037_0000": "There is no place better suited to me and my Titania. Don't you agree?",
    "HDIvo_0037_0010": "One, I'm not your Titania.\r\nAnd two, there's no place suited to you. Period.",
    "HDIvo_0038_0000": "Ah, so this is you and the boy's little nest.",
    "HDIvo_0038_0010": "Nice, isn't it?",
    "HDIvo_0038_0020": "It's a far cry from the Cathedral, but it has a certain rustic charm.\r\nI'll give it that.",
    "HDIvo_0039_0000": "Having lots of friends around is nice, but I miss it being just\r\nthe three of us.",
    "HDIvo_0039_0010": "Me too. When all this is over, let's go on a family trip. How does that sound?",
    "HDIvo_0039_0020": "That sounds great! We could bring your special sandwiches and have a picnic!",
    "HDIvo_0040_0000": "Hm, maybe I'll take a little break too.",
    "HDIvo_0040_0010": "Your gun looks like it weighs a ton. It must be hard carrying it around.",
    "HDIvo_0040_0020": "It doesn't tire me out so much as it stiffens me up.",
    "HDIvo_0040_0030": "Oh, I get it. I could give you a shoulder rub?",
    "HDIvo_0040_0040": "Well, I can't say no to that. Thanks.",
    "HDIvo_0041_0000": "It's kind of weird, fighting non-GGO enemies with my GGO gun.",
    "HDIvo_0041_0010": "Well, we are stuck in a weird mash-up of worlds.\r\nYou'll be able to handle whatever shows up, at least!",
    "HDIvo_0041_0020": "You're so easygoing, Liz. Not that I don't like that about you.",
    "HDIvo_0042_0000": "It feels funny having Yuna fight alongside us.",
    "HDIvo_0042_0010": "Y-Yeah! The situation could be better, \r\nbut it sure is exciting!",
    "HDIvo_0042_0020": "It's okay to be excited, but don't let it distract you.",
    "HDIvo_0043_0000": "All this sitting around is making me antsy. I'm gonna lose my edge!",
    "HDIvo_0043_0010": "Why don't you help me with target practice? You get to dodge my bullets!",
    "HDIvo_0043_0020": "Say no more, I'm in!",
    "HDIvo_0044_0000": "Death Gun didn't try to pull anything on the way here, did he?",
    "HDIvo_0044_0010": "Hm? It wasn't exactly smooth sailing, but Silica and Yuna\r\nwere a big help with keeping him in line.",
    "HDIvo_0044_0020": "They were?!",
    "HDIvo_0044_0030": "Yup. Felt like they were the ones pushin' him around. Every group has its\r\ndynamics, I guess. Might be worth mixing things up once in a while.",
    "HDIvo_0045_0000": "Do you mind if I check out your gun, Sinon? I've been wondering how it feels.",
    "HDIvo_0045_0010": "Sure thing. It's heavy though. Don't hurt yourself.",
    "HDIvo_0045_0020": "Whoa, no kidding! This is way too much gun for me!\r\nStill super cute, though!",
    "HDIvo_0045_0030": "Cute? Heh, I guess you could say that. We are pretty close.\r\nI think I like it.",
    "HDIvo_0046_0000": "Is that a rapid-fire grenade launcher? You always pick\r\ninteresting loadouts, Fuka.",
    "HDIvo_0046_0010": "Well, thanks, Sinon! Wanna shoot one off? It's quite a show!",
    "HDIvo_0046_0020": "Uh, you realize this is a log cabin, right? That wouldn't end well.",
    "HDIvo_0047_0000": "Have you gotten used to this world yet, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0047_0010": "Yes. I believe I can acclimate to any world as long as Kirito is there.",
    "HDIvo_0047_0020": "You and me both...",
    "HDIvo_0048_0000": "Kirito sure does have a lot of friends. I guess that's what happens\r\nwhen you're as good natured as he is.",
    "HDIvo_0048_0010": "That's true. He's saved so many, myself included.",
    "HDIvo_0048_0020": "Really? I'd like to hear about it sometime!",
    "HDIvo_0048_0030": "Sure. It's a long story though, so make sure you're prepared.",
    "HDIvo_0049_0000": "You seem awfully excited, considering the situation.",
    "HDIvo_0049_0010": "On the contrary, it is precisely because of the situation!\r\nNothing quite piques my interest like a novel phenomenon.",
    "HDIvo_0050_0000": "Ugh. I didn't expect to see you again.",
    "HDIvo_0050_0010": "Try anything and I'll give you a new hole right between the eyes.",
    "HDIvo_0050_0020": "Go ahead. You'd get a parting gift from me not long after.",
    "HDIvo_0051_0000": "I like to listen to your songs when we fight,\r\nbut it's nice to chill out to them too.",
    "HDIvo_0051_0010": "Why don't you join in?",
    "HDIvo_0051_0020": "Me? Well, I guess I could. But only for a little bit!",
    "HDIvo_0052_0000": "Are you feeling better? I was shocked when you charged right\r\nat the Skull Reaper.",
    "HDIvo_0052_0010": "Sorry about that. I won't make such a foolish mistake again.",
    "HDIvo_0052_0020": "I get why you did it. But you have friends.\r\nYou can rely on us.",
    "HDIvo_0053_0000": "Would you be so kind as to make Fairy King Oberon a cup of tea?",
    "HDIvo_0053_0010": "Just a moment, Your Majesty. I'll begin preparations immediately.",
    "HDIvo_0053_0020": "You seem to have a more discerning eye for grandeur than the others.\r\nWh-Why are you taking out your gun?",
    "HDIvo_0053_0030": "These are my preparations. For putting new holes in your face, of course.",
    "HDIvo_0053_0040": "What?! F-Fine, you've made your point! I'll brew my own tea!",
    "HDIvo_0054_0000": "Seems you've gotten quite used to this world, Quinella.",
    "HDIvo_0054_0010": "If I am to rule this place, I must first acclimate to the environment.",
    "HDIvo_0054_0020": "You're planning to rule? Can that even be done?",
    "HDIvo_0054_0030": "Of course. I am absolute. It may take some time, but eventually all worlds\r\nwill come under my dominion.",
    "HDIvo_0055_0000": "Is there anyone you're afraid of? You know, like that guy with the skull mask?",
    "HDIvo_0055_0010": "You mean Death Gun? He doesn't scare me!\r\nBesides, he's useful in battle.",
    "HDIvo_0055_0020": "Good. Let me know if he gives you a problem.\r\nI'll make sure he regrets it.",
    "HDIvo_0056_0000": "What's up, Liz? I've never seen your eyes sparkle like that.",
    "HDIvo_0056_0010": "Hmm? I'm just looking at everyone's weapons.\r\nSo many new kinds! I'm getting the itch!",
    "HDIvo_0056_0020": "That's so like you. It's definitely worth having a blacksmith around with\r\nall these weapons to repair!",
    "HDIvo_0057_0000": "Hey Silica, what do you think of Yuna singing live?",
    "HDIvo_0057_0010": "Leafa! I've been dying to gush about this!\r\nYou really wanna know?",
    "HDIvo_0057_0020": "I get the feeling this might take a while...",
    "HDIvo_0058_0000": "Will you duel me again, Yuuki?",
    "HDIvo_0058_0010": "Love to! I won't go easy on you, though!",
    "HDIvo_0058_0020": "Awesome! I don't plan on losing either!\r\nI've been practicing with Kirito!",
    "HDIvo_0059_0000": "Hey, Argo, where do you find out all the stuff you know?",
    "HDIvo_0059_0010": "Heh! That'll cost ya a pretty penny! Still wanna know?",
    "HDIvo_0059_0020": "Oh. Never mind then.",
    "HDIvo_0060_0000": "Being in this cabin makes it feel like any old normal day.",
    "HDIvo_0060_0010": "True. Different faces, but a change is nice sometimes, you know?\r\nPlus, we made some new connections.",
    "HDIvo_0060_0020": "What's that creepy grin about, Klein?",
    "HDIvo_0060_0030": "What? I wasn't thinking about Quinella! I swear!",
    "HDIvo_0060_0040": "Right. I'm sure you weren't.",
    "HDIvo_0061_0000": "Find any rare items, Agil?",
    "HDIvo_0061_0010": "No luck. Wanna go hunting with me? I'll give you a cut.",
    "HDIvo_0061_0020": "Fine by me, but it's gotta be fifty-fifty!",
    "HDIvo_0062_0000": "Why'd you pick such a pink outfit, LLENN?\r\nDoesn't it stand out on the battlefield?",
    "HDIvo_0062_0010": "This? Cute, right? It blends right in with the reddish hue of GGO's desert\r\nlandscapes!",
    "HDIvo_0062_0020": "Oh! Maybe I'll try dressing in sky blue camouflage then!",
    "HDIvo_0063_0000": "Rightony and Leftania are looking as cute as ever!",
    "HDIvo_0063_0010": "Who are Rightony and Leftania?",
    "HDIvo_0063_0020": "My weapons, of course! Doesn't your weapon have a name?\r\nI could think of one for ya!",
    "HDIvo_0063_0030": "N-No, thank you!",
    "HDIvo_0064_0000": "Your sword technique is impeccable, Leafa.\r\nGraceful and free of unnecessary movements.",
    "HDIvo_0064_0010": "I'm honored that you think so! I think it's because I practice kendo every day!",
    "HDIvo_0064_0020": "A regular training regimen is crucial. Yours is a good example to follow.",
    "HDIvo_0065_0000": "What's Kirito like at home?\r\nDoes he have a hidden side?",
    "HDIvo_0065_0010": "Hidden? Hmm. Well, we take turns cooking, so he does that sometimes.",
    "HDIvo_0065_0020": "He cooks? That is unexpected!\r\nI think I'll ask him to make me something sometime.",
    "HDIvo_0065_0030": "Careful, or all you'll be eating is pasta.",
    "HDIvo_0066_0000": "You are Kirito's sister, yes?",
    "HDIvo_0066_0010": "That's right. I might not be as chill or nowhere near as smart as him,\r\nbut we get along great!",
    "HDIvo_0066_0020": "Haha. I can tell you do.\r\nYou complement each other well.",
    "HDIvo_0067_0000": "Death Gun, it's scary when you're always glaring like that. It would be nice if you could relax a little bit...",
    "HDIvo_0067_0010": "Hmph. I could never expose such weakness as you do.",
    "HDIvo_0067_0020": "Hey! Who're you calling weak?! How rude!",
    "HDIvo_0068_0000": "Your singing can turn any place into a stage, Yuna.",
    "HDIvo_0068_0010": "Why thank you, Leafa! Is there any place in particular you'd like me to sing?",
    "HDIvo_0068_0020": "Hmm. It would be cool to get all the tribes together and throw a concert\r\nat the World Tree in ALO!",
    "HDIvo_0068_0030": "That sounds wonderful!",
    "HDIvo_0069_0000": "Doesn't being so tense tire you out, Eiji? Why don't you ease up for a bit?",
    "HDIvo_0069_0010": "This is no time for rest. I'm amazed you can manage to relax at all.",
    "HDIvo_0069_0020": "Really? Maybe I'm just less high-strung.",
    "HDIvo_0070_0000": "You. Sylph girl. I require refreshments.",
    "HDIvo_0070_0010": "Do it yourself. What made you so self-important?",
    "HDIvo_0070_0020": "I am not self-important, only important. And you, girl, are lacking in courtesy.",
    "HDIvo_0071_0000": "And you are the boy's sister, I presume?",
    "HDIvo_0071_0010": "That's right. How do you know my brother?",
    "HDIvo_0071_0020": "Oh, my. A simple question with a complicated answer.\r\nWould you like to hear the story?",
    "HDIvo_0071_0030": "What? Complicated how?! Spill it, you!",
    "HDIvo_0072_0000": "Yui! Yui!\r\nCome over here!",
    "HDIvo_0072_0010": "Yes? What is it?",
    "HDIvo_0072_0020": "Get this! I was looking around and found these rare fruits!\r\nWant to eat them together?",
    "HDIvo_0072_0030": "Wow! You don't mind? They look yummy!",
    "HDIvo_0072_0040": "I only have two, so don't tell the others!",
    "HDIvo_0073_0000": "Aren't you lucky, Silica! You can get as many of Yuna's autographs as you want!",
    "HDIvo_0073_0010": "Ooh! But she's kind of off-the-clock. Do you think it's okay?",
    "HDIvo_0073_0020": "Why not? She looks bored, anyway.",
    "HDIvo_0073_0030": "B-But what if I bother her and she gets annoyed at me?\r\nI can't do it! Ask her for me, Liz! Please!",
    "HDIvo_0073_0040": "For real? Silica, what am I gonna do with you?\r\nFine. But you owe me a parfait.",
    "HDIvo_0074_0000": "It's nice having you on our side, Yuuki.\r\nYou really deserve your \"Absolute Sword\" title.",
    "HDIvo_0074_0010": "You've got nothing to worry about with me around!\r\nI'll take care of you, so you take care of my sword, okay?",
    "HDIvo_0074_0020": "No problem!\r\nJust bring it by when the blade gets dull, and I'll sharpen it right up!",
    "HDIvo_0075_0000": "We would have been in trouble if it weren't for Eugeo and LLENN's help.",
    "HDIvo_0075_0010": "No kidding. That's why I'm planning on offerin' them a discount!",
    "HDIvo_0075_0020": "I'm jealous.\r\nCan't you clue me in on where to find rare drops for a good price?",
    "HDIvo_0075_0030": "Sorry, no can do! I don't remember you ever saving my skin!\r\nGotta scratch my back before I scratch yours!",
    "HDIvo_0075_0040": "Come on, don't be so stingy!",
    "HDIvo_0076_0000": "Hey, Klein! I heard you got yourself locked up in a cage!",
    "HDIvo_0076_0010": "Gah! Who told you about that?",
    "HDIvo_0076_0020": "Hahaha! Just thinking about it cracks me up!\r\nKirito took the trouble to save you, so make yourself useful!",
    "HDIvo_0077_0000": "Find any good items, Agil?",
    "HDIvo_0077_0010": "Yup. The world may be screwed seven ways to Sunday,\r\nbut there's no shortage of good drops.",
    "HDIvo_0077_0020": "Leave it to Agil to find the good stuff!\r\nYou'll help me craft a rare weapon, right?",
    "HDIvo_0078_0000": "I love your outfit, Liz!",
    "HDIvo_0078_0010": "Oh, this? Asuna picked it out. I'm pretty happy with it.\r\nHelps make an impression with customers too.",
    "HDIvo_0078_0020": "She has good taste! It fits you perfectly!\r\nNobody can say no to a girl with style!",
    "HDIvo_0078_0030": "Doesn't really help against beasts, though. Haha!",
    "HDIvo_0079_0000": "This tension is totally different from GGO. I could get used to it!",
    "HDIvo_0079_0010": "You don't seem very concerned, given the situation.",
    "HDIvo_0080_0000": "I've been wondering why is Kirito surrounded by so many women?",
    "HDIvo_0080_0010": "Oh, I wish I knew, believe me! Feels like there's some conniving going on.",
    "HDIvo_0081_0000": "Whoa! Your sword is a real piece of work, Eugeo!\r\nThe craftsmanship really shows when you get in close!",
    "HDIvo_0081_0010": "Oh, that's right, you're a blacksmith.\r\nWould you mind doing a little maintenance on it?",
    "HDIvo_0081_0020": "Would I! Wow! It's as slick as ice! And look at it shine!\r\nOkay buddy, Liz is gonna polish you up real nice!",
    "HDIvo_0082_0000": "You seem awfully content with this situation, Heathcliff.\r\nI just can't calm down.",
    "HDIvo_0082_0010": "There's no point in fretting.\r\nWe should compile what information we've learned and recupe.",
    "HDIvo_0082_0020": "Argh! I only wish I could be so grown-up!",
    "HDIvo_0083_0000": "You seem awfully interested in us.\r\nDon't try anything funny.",
    "HDIvo_0083_0010": "I wouldn't waste bullets on the likes of you.",
    "HDIvo_0083_0020": "E-Excuse me?! Whatever, just keep your gun to yourself!",
    "HDIvo_0084_0000": "Hey Yuna, you came here with that scary Death Gun guy, right?\r\nThat must have been rough!",
    "HDIvo_0084_0010": "I had Agil and Silica with me too. He is a little scary, but it was good to have\r\nsomeone so strong with us. He even listened to my music.",
    "HDIvo_0084_0020": "He did?! That weirdo? I guess you really are adored by everyone!",
    "HDIvo_0085_0000": "Why don't you take it easy, Eiji? Your face is gonna get stuck like that.",
    "HDIvo_0085_0010": "And how do you expect me to take it easy with all that's going on?\r\nAnd all these people buzzing around?",
    "HDIvo_0085_0020": "You have a point there. But stressing out won't help anything.\r\nBe calm.",
    "HDIvo_0086_0000": "What makes you people think such a crude and tiny room is suitable for a king?",
    "HDIvo_0086_0010": "Excuse me?! You're welcome to wait outside!\r\nJust don't come crying when the monsters come for you!",
    "HDIvo_0086_0020": "Wh-Who said anything about waiting outside?\r\nI was only hoping there might be more suitable quarters available.",
    "HDIvo_0086_0030": "Next time you complain, I'm kicking you out.",
    "HDIvo_0087_0000": "You seem absolutely fine, Quinella.\r\nMore than that, you seem to be enjoying this.",
    "HDIvo_0087_0010": "I am fine. The beasts in this world are far too weak to pose a threat to me.\r\nIt's hardly worth the effort.",
    "HDIvo_0087_0020": "But if you don't help, who will?",
    "HDIvo_0087_0030": "You and your little friends, of course.\r\nI trust you are capable of getting along on your own.",
    "HDIvo_0087_0040": "Hey, don't treat us like your puppets!\r\nI am glad someone strong like you is here, though.",
    "HDIvo_0088_0000": "I was so surprised when we found you locked up, Yui.\r\nI'm glad you weren't hurt!",
    "HDIvo_0088_0010": "Thank you for saving me!",
    "HDIvo_0088_0020": "You should have seen Kirito! He went full dad mode! Ran off without a word!\r\nHe really loves you.",
    "HDIvo_0088_0030": "Ehehe... I'm really happy. But I'm sorry for worrying everyone.\r\nI'll be careful not to get caught again!",
    "HDIvo_0089_0000": "Oh, I'm so nervous!\r\nPina isn't herself either!",
    "HDIvo_0089_0010": "It'll be okay, Silica. I'm here.\r\nWe'll get through this together, so don't give up. You either, Pina.",
    "HDIvo_0089_0020": "Okay... Thank you. That makes me feel better. You hear that, Pina?\r\nYuuki's going to help!",
    "HDIvo_0090_0000": "What are you looking around like that for, Argo?",
    "HDIvo_0090_0010": "Poking around for material, of course!\r\nIt's not every day you get this many interesting characters in one spot!",
    "HDIvo_0090_0020": "You never let an opportunity slip by, do you?",
    "HDIvo_0091_0000": "You actually fought alongside that creepy Death Gun guy?",
    "HDIvo_0091_0010": "Y-Yes. I was surprised, too.\r\nWe actually work well together in battle.",
    "HDIvo_0091_0020": "You're a brave one, Silica. I'd be too scared of the guy to go near him.",
    "HDIvo_0092_0000": "Heard it was just you and Death Gun before we found you.",
    "HDIvo_0092_0010": "Yes. It was a trial of sorts.",
    "HDIvo_0092_0020": "I'm impressed. It must have taken guts to team up with that guy.",
    "HDIvo_0092_0030": "Just hearing you say that makes it all worth it.",
    "HDIvo_0093_0000": "You're such a cutie, Silica! I'm so jealous!",
    "HDIvo_0093_0010": "I might look small, but I bring a big fight!",
    "HDIvo_0093_0020": "Cute and confident! That's the way, girl!",
    "HDIvo_0094_0000": "I'm famished! I don't care what it is, I just need to eat!",
    "HDIvo_0094_0010": "We could all have sweets!",
    "HDIvo_0094_0020": "Now there's an idea!\r\nLet's make a whole shindig out of it!",
    "HDIvo_0095_0000": "Did you have a hard time getting here, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0095_0010": "Sinon and Yuuki made it easy,\r\nbut we did have a parasite who was less interested in cooperating.",
    "HDIvo_0095_0020": "Alice? You have a big wrinkle on your forehead that wasn't there a second ago.",
    "HDIvo_0095_0030": "Forgive my lack of composure. There were some difficulties, but we suffered no\r\nmajor injuries. Let's just leave it at that.",
    "HDIvo_0096_0000": "Your Release Recollection is perfect for stopping enemies in their tracks!",
    "HDIvo_0096_0010": "Thanks. I hope it will help me protect you all when the need arises.",
    "HDIvo_0096_0020": "I think it's a wonderful move! Pina thinks so too!",
    "HDIvo_0097_0000": "Phew. I'm pooped.",
    "HDIvo_0097_0010": "It's important to get sufficient rest for the battles ahead.",
    "HDIvo_0097_0020": "Right! That goes for you too, Pina!",
    "HDIvo_0098_0000": "The happy-go-lucky girl with the sickly pet...",
    "HDIvo_0098_0010": "Don't call Pina sickly!\r\nDid you forget when she saved you with her Healing Breath?",
    "HDIvo_0098_0020": "Hmph. Keep it away from me.\r\nIf it gets in my way, I'll shoot.",
    "HDIvo_0099_0000": "Y-Yuna! Um, um...\r\nWould you please t-take a picture with me?",
    "HDIvo_0099_0010": "Sure! Let's strike a cute pose together!",
    "HDIvo_0099_0020": "W-We did it! Pina, we did it! It's a dream come true!\r\nIs my hair okay? Oh, I hope it's not messy!",
    "HDIvo_0100_0000": "You're a beast tamer? Did you tame that dragon in ALO?",
    "HDIvo_0100_0010": "No, we've been together since SAO. She's stuck with me through a lot.",
    "HDIvo_0100_0020": "I see.\r\nI understand how comforting it can be having a close companion by your side.",
    "HDIvo_0101_0000": "How exhausting. Mm? My, that dragon's soft coat would make a fine pillow.",
    "HDIvo_0101_0010": "WHAT?! Pina is NOT a pillow!",
    "HDIvo_0101_0020": "Not yet.\r\nIt can certainly be arranged.",
    "HDIvo_0101_0030": "ABSOLUTELY NOT!",
    "HDIvo_0102_0000": "I wish I could be as confident as you, Quinella. You're so grown-up!\r\nYou make it look easy!",
    "HDIvo_0102_0010": "Confident? Interesting. It's not something I'm normally aware of.\r\nSo that's how you see me.",
    "HDIvo_0102_0020": "O-Oh. So you just, like, ooze confidence all the time? I want to be that mature!",
    "HDIvo_0103_0000": "Thank you for everything, Silica. You must be tired! You too, Pina!",
    "HDIvo_0103_0010": "No problem, Yui! You didn't take too much damage, did you?",
    "HDIvo_0103_0020": "Nope! I've been getting used to fighting little by little!\r\nI hope I can really help everyone!",
    "HDIvo_0103_0030": "Good! I'll be counting on you!",
    "HDIvo_0103_0040": "You got it!",
    "HDIvo_0104_0000": "Hey Yuuki, tell me whatcha got up to before you met up with us!",
    "HDIvo_0104_0010": "Oh, it was crazy! But Sinon's sniping was on point!\r\nSo was Alice with her sword! I'm glad they were around!",
    "HDIvo_0104_0020": "Mm? Wasn't Oberon with you too?",
    "HDIvo_0104_0030": "Oh, yeah! He was there. Yeah, he did something... I think?",
    "HDIvo_0104_0040": "Oh, I think I have a good idea what you mean.",
    "HDIvo_0105_0000": "I like your traditional Japanese-style armor, Klein! Very cool!",
    "HDIvo_0105_0010": "Heck yeah! Every man looks up to the samurai!\r\nI feel tougher just by putting it on!",
    "HDIvo_0105_0020": "I haven't worn something like that in a long time.\r\nI kinda want to get in on this. Maybe I'll change up my look.",
    "HDIvo_0106_0000": "You came here with Yuna, Silica, and Death Gun, right?\r\nSounds like an interesting group!",
    "HDIvo_0106_0010": "It was a mess. Yuna and Death Gun made a hell of a pair, though.",
    "HDIvo_0106_0020": "Our group was fun too. Sinon and Alice were dependable, but Oberon was...",
    "HDIvo_0106_0030": "Sinon, Alice, and Oberon, huh?\r\nSounds like you must've had some weird chemistry.",
    "HDIvo_0107_0000": "You swung your sword so fast I couldn't even see it!\r\nThat'd be super useful in GGO! You should visit!",
    "HDIvo_0107_0010": "But you're fast on your feet! I ended up going with ALO, but what about you?\r\nAre you interested in other games?",
    "HDIvo_0107_0020": "Oh, um, yeah. I guess so.",
    "HDIvo_0107_0030": "Great! You should come to ALO then!\r\nI bet you'd make a great knight!",
    "HDIvo_0107_0040": "Maybe, but I had a kind of traumatic experience with ALO. Haha...",
    "HDIvo_0108_0000": "You, Sinon, LLENN, Death Gun, eh?\r\nI find GGO players to be a cool if a bit odd bunch.",
    "HDIvo_0108_0010": "True. But we're not near the weirdest people I've met!",
    "HDIvo_0108_0020": "No? What other kind of people play?",
    "HDIvo_0108_0030": "Trigger-happy maniacs, masochists, oh, and squads of pro-level Amazonian\r\nwarriors who are actually high school kids IRL.",
    "HDIvo_0108_0040": "That sounds cool! I want to try too!\r\nI'll pop over to GGO sometime!",
    "HDIvo_0109_0000": "Something bothering you, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0109_0010": "I heard Galaxia lets you relive your past.\r\nI was thinking that might be nice.",
    "HDIvo_0109_0020": "You wouldn't be reliving it exactly since it'd be in a game.\r\nIs there something you want to experience again?",
    "HDIvo_0109_0030": "Yes. A missing memory. One I lost, but which lives on in Kirito and Eugeo.\r\nAt times I wish I could get it back.",
    "HDIvo_0109_0040": "I don't know what happened, but I think I can sympathize with how you must feel.",
    "HDIvo_0109_0050": "What about you? Is there something you'd like to re-experience?",
    "HDIvo_0109_0060": "Yeah. A whole lot, actually. But I like \"now\" all the same.\r\nI want to enjoy what I have in front of me. Know what I mean?",
    "HDIvo_0109_0070": "What you say is true; the present becomes the past.\r\nWe should treasure what we have while we can.",
    "HDIvo_0110_0000": "You're amazing, Eugeo. You get along with everyone.",
    "HDIvo_0110_0010": "You think so? The same goes for you. Everyone warmed up to you right away.",
    "HDIvo_0110_0020": "There are some people I just can't get along with.\r\nLike Death Gun or Heathcliff!",
    "HDIvo_0110_0030": "I know what you mean. Heathcliff is too serious, and Death Gun can be prickly.",
    "HDIvo_0110_0040": "Exactly! I think we're on the same wavelength!",
    "HDIvo_0111_0000": "Oberon isn't much of a fighter considering he's always making a\r\nbig deal about being a \"king.\"",
    "HDIvo_0111_0010": "That's simply the way he is.\r\nIt's his nature.",
    "HDIvo_0111_0020": "Really? But he has the skill and the brains.\r\nYou'd think he'd use them.",
    "HDIvo_0112_0000": "Thoughtless. Brainless.\r\nHow irritating you all are.",
    "HDIvo_0112_0010": "You don't want to join the chat? The more the merrier!",
    "HDIvo_0112_0020": "Hilarious. One bit of chatter and I'll shoot.",
    "HDIvo_0112_0030": "I really thought you'd enjoy talking with us, though.",
    "HDIvo_0113_0000": "Hmm.",
    "HDIvo_0113_0010": "What's on your mind, Yuna?",
    "HDIvo_0113_0020": "I was pondering how I can convert Death Gun into a fan.",
    "HDIvo_0113_0030": "It's not worth the trouble if you ask me.",
    "HDIvo_0113_0040": "He seemed to enjoy a few of my songs, actually.\r\nBetween us, my plan is to make fans out of everyone in the cabin!",
    "HDIvo_0113_0050": "No way. He listened to your music? You must be some kind of miracle worker!\r\nHe might even become a fan!",
    "HDIvo_0114_0000": "You and Yuna are so cute! Just watching you brightens up my day.\r\nI'm a little jealous!",
    "HDIvo_0114_0010": "We've always been close. But you have a similar relationship, don't you?\r\nYou and Asuna, I mean.",
    "HDIvo_0114_0020": "You can tell? That's so embarrassing!\r\nWell, we are best friends, so yeah, I'm always excited to see her.",
    "HDIvo_0115_0000": "Hey Oberon, can you help me do some recon?\r\nThere's a spot I want to check out.",
    "HDIvo_0115_0010": "What king in his right mind would willingly put himself in danger?\r\nScouting is a task for subordinates.",
    "HDIvo_0115_0020": "I never said it was dangerous!\r\nYou're such a chicken!",
    "HDIvo_0116_0000": "You seem like such a patient and mature person.\r\nI wish I could be like you!",
    "HDIvo_0116_0010": "Hehe, there is nothing wrong with how you are now. You're very endearing.",
    "HDIvo_0116_0020": "Th-Thanks! I don't think I've ever been called endearing before!\r\nMy cheeks feel warm.",
    "HDIvo_0117_0000": "You're really good with a sword, Yuuki! I wish I could learn!",
    "HDIvo_0117_0010": "You should! Want me to teach you?",
    "HDIvo_0117_0020": "You don't mind?",
    "HDIvo_0117_0030": "Not at all! From now on, you can call me mentor!",
    "HDIvo_0117_0040": "Wow! Thank you, Mentor Yuuki!",
    "HDIvo_0118_0000": "What's up, Argo? Everything good on your end?",
    "HDIvo_0118_0010": "Yup, thanks to LLENN and Eugeo!\r\nI heard ya got locked up?",
    "HDIvo_0118_0020": "How do you know about that?\r\nDon't you go peddlin' that dubious data to the others!",
    "HDIvo_0118_0030": "Hah! Sorry, but when there's demand I gotta supply! You're a best-seller!\r\nKeep the antics coming!",
    "HDIvo_0118_0040": "Hey, I didn't agree to this!",
    "HDIvo_0119_0000": "Hey there, Info Broker. Got anything good for me?",
    "HDIvo_0119_0010": "Let's see. Well, I've got another one of Klein's blunders, if that's your bag.",
    "HDIvo_0119_0020": "I'll pass.",
    "HDIvo_0120_0000": "LLENN and Eugeo saved our bacon!\r\nWe woulda been in big trouble if it weren't for them!",
    "HDIvo_0120_0010": "The same goes for you and Lisbeth.\r\nYou helped us find the rest of the group.",
    "HDIvo_0120_0020": "For what it's worth, I'll give you a discount on your next bit of info.",
    "HDIvo_0120_0030": "Really? Okay!\r\nI'll let you know when I think of something!",
    "HDIvo_0121_0000": "*sigh*",
    "HDIvo_0121_0010": "You look awfully relaxed.",
    "HDIvo_0121_0020": "It's so much safer here compared to GGO.\r\nYou can never let go and chill in there.",
    "HDIvo_0121_0030": "Right? I don't think any enemies will be breaking into the cabin for now,\r\nso let's enjoy it.",
    "HDIvo_0122_0000": "What's the frown for, Allie?",
    "HDIvo_0122_0010": "You sell info, yes?\r\nWould you tell me why Kirito has so many lady friends?",
    "HDIvo_0122_0020": "To be honest, that's about the only thing I couldn't tell ya.",
    "HDIvo_0123_0000": "Thanks for back there, Eugeo.\r\nIf not for you and LLENN, we'd have been in real trouble.",
    "HDIvo_0123_0010": "I'm glad you and Lisbeth are okay. You've both taught me so much about this\r\nworld. I hope we can keep helping each other out.",
    "HDIvo_0123_0020": "If only certain other members were as agreeable as you.",
    "HDIvo_0124_0000": "You seem relaxed, Heathcliff.\r\nYou know something about Galaxia we don't?",
    "HDIvo_0124_0010": "Heheh. Unfortunately, I only have the same knowledge as the rest of you.",
    "HDIvo_0124_0020": "Darn. That'd be one valuable piece of info if ya did.\r\nThis is a frustratin' situation for an info broker.",
    "HDIvo_0125_0000": "Oh, it's you. I admit it's nice having you on our side.\r\nJust don't turn on us.",
    "HDIvo_0125_0010": "On your side?\r\nAt best we share a common goal.",
    "HDIvo_0125_0020": "Same thing, really.\r\nAt least the tension keeps things interesting.",
    "HDIvo_0126_0000": "You look like you're havin' fun, Yuna.\r\nAren'tcha sad ya can't get on stage?",
    "HDIvo_0126_0010": "I don't need one.\r\nMy stage is wherever I sing.",
    "HDIvo_0126_0020": "Guess that's why they call you a diva.\r\nIn that case, would you perform now?",
    "HDIvo_0127_0000": "Hey, Eiji. Wanna help me gather materials?\r\nIt'll be 100% safe, I promise!",
    "HDIvo_0127_0010": "No.",
    "HDIvo_0127_0020": "I ain't even told ya what kind yet!",
    "HDIvo_0128_0000": "You! Rat girl! What are you loitering for?\r\nYou're disrupting my peace.",
    "HDIvo_0128_0010": "They might call me Argo the Rat, but \"rat girl\" is a bit much.\r\nAnd I'm gatherin' information!",
    "HDIvo_0128_0020": "Oh? How would you like to hear the exploits of the great Fairy King Oberon?\r\nI'll tell you my whole tale.",
    "HDIvo_0128_0030": "I'm good! I've already gotten all the info I need! Hehe!",
    "HDIvo_0129_0000": "You really bewitch the boys, don'tcha, Quinella?\r\nYou've got powerful feminine vibes.",
    "HDIvo_0129_0010": "You'd like to know my secrets, wouldn't you? Very well.\r\nCome here and I'll teach you whatever you like.",
    "HDIvo_0129_0020": "N-Never mind! I'm not sure I'm ready for that!",
    "HDIvo_0130_0000": "Heya, Yui. You find anythin' out about Galaxia?",
    "HDIvo_0130_0010": "Not in the least. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.",
    "HDIvo_0130_0020": "Ah, don't let it get to ya! I didn't find nothin' either.\r\nI'm a little disappointed in myself as an info broker.",
    "HDIvo_0131_0000": "What's up, Klein? Looks like you've got something on your mind.",
    "HDIvo_0131_0010": "Man, have I got a story for you.\r\nIt's a real heroic tale.",
    "HDIvo_0131_0020": "This about when Kirito broke you out of that cage? What's so heroic about that?",
    "HDIvo_0131_0030": "Gah! Who told you about that?!",
    "HDIvo_0132_0000": "Sinon might have an eagle eye, but you're the queen of rapid fire!",
    "HDIvo_0132_0010": "Well, I did pump my speed stat!\r\nI don't think I could even aim a big gun like Sinon's!",
    "HDIvo_0132_0020": "Having your own specialties makes you a good team. Sinon brings the strength,\r\nand you bring the speed. It's an unstoppable combo!",
    "HDIvo_0133_0000": "You play ALO too, right?\r\nWhat race do you play?",
    "HDIvo_0133_0010": "Heh, in ALO I'm a crazy powerful and sexy Sylph warrior.\r\nTwo-handed blade, battleaxe, lance, you name it, I can wield it!",
    "HDIvo_0133_0020": "A-Are you really a Sylph?",
    "HDIvo_0134_0000": "Resting, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0134_0010": "Yes. This is quite a comfortable place.",
    "HDIvo_0134_0020": "Make yourself at home!\r\nCan I say that if I don't live here?",
    "HDIvo_0135_0000": "You use the Aincrad Style too, don't you Klein?\r\nWe should spar sometime!",
    "HDIvo_0135_0010": "Cool! If any sword fighting style from Aincrad counts, then Asuna, Eiji,\r\nand Heathcliff all use it too.",
    "HDIvo_0135_0020": "I had thought Kirito and I were the only Aincrad Style users until recently.\r\nI'm glad to meet so many others!",
    "HDIvo_0135_0030": "Lots of sparring partners to have fun with.\r\nNone as strong as me, though!",
    "HDIvo_0136_0000": "*sigh* I wonder if I'll ever get Quinella's attention.\r\nWhat should I do, Heathcliff?",
    "HDIvo_0136_0010": "The key is to know your target.\r\nCollect and analyze what intel you can to form a strategy.",
    "HDIvo_0136_0020": "O-Oh!\r\nI'm gonna be honest, I didn't expect a serious answer!",
    "HDIvo_0137_0000": "You're lookin' as scary as ever.\r\nWhy don't you take a load off?",
    "HDIvo_0137_0010": "I'm not weak like you.",
    "HDIvo_0137_0020": "Who're you calling weak?!\r\nNobody's more manly than this paragon of manliness!",
    "HDIvo_0138_0000": "Man, I can't believe I get to listen to you sing live in a cozy log cabin!\r\nI'm livin' the dream!",
    "HDIvo_0138_0010": "Don't get too relaxed, Klein!",
    "HDIvo_0138_0020": "What? Why not?",
    "HDIvo_0138_0030": "Come on, get clapping!\r\nTime to turn up the tempo!",
    "HDIvo_0139_0000": "A lot has gone down.\r\nBut we still need to recharge. Loosen up and let your hair down.",
    "HDIvo_0139_0010": "Right. Thank you.",
    "HDIvo_0140_0000": "Don't hog all the space to yourself!\r\nThe rest of us need to fit in here too!",
    "HDIvo_0140_0010": "Ho? Do you feel intimidated by my kingly presence?",
    "HDIvo_0140_0020": "I'm just sayin' you're in the dang way!",
    "HDIvo_0141_0000": "I demand a shoulder massage. All of this fighting has made my back so stiff.",
    "HDIvo_0141_0010": "Y-Yes, ma'am! It would be my pleasure!",
    "HDIvo_0141_0020": "Teehee! I've found myself a useful servant.",
    "HDIvo_0142_0000": "Man am I glad you're okay, little lady.\r\nKiridude really snapped when he saw you locked up!",
    "HDIvo_0142_0010": "I heard you were locked up too! We match!",
    "HDIvo_0142_0020": "Y-Yeah, I guess.\r\nBut in my case, I think Kiridude and the others think I'm a complete idiot.",
    "HDIvo_0143_0000": "Lemme know if you need any supplies, LLENN.",
    "HDIvo_0143_0010": "I will! The skills here go a long way, though!",
    "HDIvo_0143_0020": "I suppose they do, compared to GGO.\r\nAsuna and Leafa can take care of healing, too.",
    "HDIvo_0143_0030": "We don't have anything like that in GGO.\r\nIt's hard, but that's what makes it fun!",
    "HDIvo_0144_0000": "You're a merchant right? Have any crazy ammo?",
    "HDIvo_0144_0010": "Crazy? For example?",
    "HDIvo_0144_0020": "How about ammo that sucks up all the money in an area with only one shot?",
    "HDIvo_0144_0030": "That really is crazy...",
    "HDIvo_0145_0000": "What's got you so restless, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0145_0010": "My movements seem to be getting slower,\r\nso I was considering a round of training.",
    "HDIvo_0145_0020": "You think you're slow? Your attacks are lightning-fast!\r\nIf you're slow, then I guess I have a lot to learn.",
    "HDIvo_0145_0030": "A knight must hone her body as well as her skills.\r\nWould you care to join me?",
    "HDIvo_0145_0040": "Sounds like a plan.",
    "HDIvo_0146_0000": "Getting used to this world yet, Eugeo?",
    "HDIvo_0146_0010": "Gradually. But I'm surprised at how different it is from the last.\r\nIt must be hard for the others to deal with so many enemies.",
    "HDIvo_0146_0020": "It's not like every single place is teeming with monsters.\r\nAnd anyway, they give plenty of drops. Good for business.",
    "HDIvo_0146_0030": "Haha. It's always about business with you.",
    "HDIvo_0147_0000": "Have you found any useful items?",
    "HDIvo_0147_0010": "A few here and there.",
    "HDIvo_0147_0020": "Having the proper items and equipment is as important as raw skill.\r\nI hope you can help keep us well-equipped.",
    "HDIvo_0148_0000": "I've had enough of the beast tamer and the singer.",
    "HDIvo_0148_0010": "You say that, but you helped them, didn't you?",
    "HDIvo_0148_0020": "No. You are all merely my tools.\r\nAnd faulty tools get thrown out.",
    "HDIvo_0148_0030": "You've got another thing comin' if you think we'd let you do that.\r\nAnyway, we're on the same side, so let's just get along.",
    "HDIvo_0149_0000": "Your music could turn a desert into an oasis.",
    "HDIvo_0149_0010": "Thank you, Agil! Let's throw a concert!\r\nWe can invite Silica and Death Gun!",
    "HDIvo_0149_0020": "Silica I get, but Death Gun?\r\nYou're a kinder soul than I.",
    "HDIvo_0150_0000": "You better now, Eiji? Your cognitive contamination, I mean.",
    "HDIvo_0150_0010": "Yes. I'm sorry about that. I won't make such a mistake again.",
    "HDIvo_0150_0020": "Glad to hear it, but you don't have to be so on edge. Relax.\r\nYuna and the rest of us will help however much you need.",
    "HDIvo_0151_0000": "You. Merchant. I demand a massage.",
    "HDIvo_0151_0010": "Psh! Yeah, right! Only thing these hands are gonna do is squeeze your avatar\r\nright out of the game!",
    "HDIvo_0151_0020": "Eh?! Such violence is uncalled for!",
    "HDIvo_0152_0000": "That muscular body of yours would make a good shield.",
    "HDIvo_0152_0010": "I'm a tank, so I don't mind being a shield. But not your personal one.",
    "HDIvo_0152_0020": "Oh my, what a shame. Klein would have accepted without complaint.",
    "HDIvo_0153_0000": "Do you need anything, Yui?",
    "HDIvo_0153_0010": "I'm okay.\r\nBut I'd like to have some tasty snacks with everyone when this is over!",
    "HDIvo_0153_0020": "You wanna throw a party? I'll keep that in mind.",
    "HDIvo_0154_0000": "Were you okay before we met up with you guys?",
    "HDIvo_0154_0010": "You betcha! I gave the enemies a good blasting!",
    "HDIvo_0154_0020": "Really? I hope all that blasting didn't cause any collateral damage.",
    "HDIvo_0155_0000": "What are you doing, Alice?",
    "HDIvo_0155_0010": "I was considering honing my blade.\r\nI must keep it in top condition.",
    "HDIvo_0155_0020": "Nice! I think I'll give Little Miss P some TLC too!",
    "HDIvo_0156_0000": "Sorry I pointed my gun at you before, Eugeo!",
    "HDIvo_0156_0010": "You mean when we first met? It's okay, it was a hectic situation.\r\nI'm just glad you didn't shoot!",
    "HDIvo_0156_0020": "I'm really sorry!\r\nI'll make sure to only fill the enemies with holes!",
    "HDIvo_0157_0000": "Are you planning a battle strategy?",
    "HDIvo_0157_0010": "No. I am allowing myself a reprieve.\r\nI don't rack my brain around the clock.",
    "HDIvo_0157_0020": "Oh! Since you're taking a break, I guess I should too!",
    "HDIvo_0158_0000": "A noisy shrimp like you doesn't belong in GGO.",
    "HDIvo_0158_0010": "Who're you calling noisy?! Plus, I happen to think I'm pretty good!\r\nI'd even fight you to prove it! But I guess we're supposed to get along.",
    "HDIvo_0158_0020": "Hmph. Whatever. Noisy little shrimp.",
    "HDIvo_0159_0000": "If only the singer I know was like you.",
    "HDIvo_0159_0010": "What do you mean by that?",
    "HDIvo_0159_0020": "She's a trigger-happy combat buff. Basically, she knows how to fight.",
    "HDIvo_0159_0030": "I thought you said she was a singer.",
    "HDIvo_0159_0040": "Uh, a trigger-happy, combat-loving singer then.",
    "HDIvo_0159_0050": "She sounds interesting. I'd like to meet her!",
    "HDIvo_0160_0000": "Is ALO your main game, Eiji?",
    "HDIvo_0160_0010": "Yes. It has a lot of players and player friendly systems.\r\nWhy did you decide on GGO? You'd fit right in in ALO.",
    "HDIvo_0160_0020": "Ahah, I had a bad experience with ALO. Plus, GGO's easy enough too!\r\nJust shoot everyone, and you're golden!",
    "HDIvo_0160_0030": "I see. You seem to have a secret combat-hungry side.",
    "HDIvo_0161_0000": "*yawn* I'm kinda sleepy.",
    "HDIvo_0161_0010": "You display much disregard for the situation at hand.\r\nA stunning example of ignorance.",
    "HDIvo_0161_0020": "You think so?\r\nI thought it would be better to spend time resting up than freaking out.",
    "HDIvo_0162_0000": "You are quite the agile one, LLENN.\r\nPerhaps you are worthy of a place in my inner circle.",
    "HDIvo_0162_0010": "You mean you want me in your squad? I'm happy for the invite, but I can't.\r\nI have powerful friends I could introduce you to though.",
    "HDIvo_0162_0020": "As long as it isn't that Fukaziroh.",
    "HDIvo_0162_0030": "I have more friends than Fuka.\r\nA sadistic berserker, a masochistic sniper... All sorts of cool weirdos!",
    "HDIvo_0162_0040": "They certainly sound like a unique bunch.",
    "HDIvo_0163_0000": "Your gun is so cool, LLENN!",
    "HDIvo_0163_0010": "You mean Little Miss P? She's the best! She's light and packs a punch!\r\nShe'd be just right for you.",
    "HDIvo_0163_0020": "What a cute nickname for a weapon!\r\nI'd like to try firing it sometime!",
    "HDIvo_0164_0000": "I'm feeling a bit hungry.",
    "HDIvo_0164_0010": "We could have Eugeo make us a frosty treat with his Release Recollection.",
    "HDIvo_0164_0020": "I hadn't thought of that.\r\nI doubt that ice is edible though.",
    "HDIvo_0164_0030": "I thought it was a good idea. We can't fight on an empty stomach!\r\nLet's go get some snacks from Kirito!",
    "HDIvo_0165_0000": "Thanks for always helping out my partner, Eugeo!",
    "HDIvo_0165_0010": "Partner? Oh, you mean LLENN?\r\nShe's helped me out at least as much as I have her!",
    "HDIvo_0165_0020": "What's this? Are you trying to steal my spot as LLENN's partner?!\r\nI won't go down without a fight!",
    "HDIvo_0165_0030": "What? Not at all! It hadn't crossed my mind.",
    "HDIvo_0166_0000": "What are you up to, Fukaziroh?\r\nYou've been staring at your item storage with a grin on your face.",
    "HDIvo_0166_0010": "Wah! W-Were you watching me? I was looking at my secret ice cream stash.\r\nHave I been found out?",
    "HDIvo_0166_0020": "I didn't see a thing.\r\nYou did let the secret slip yourself, though.",
    "HDIvo_0166_0030": "You didn't see it? Argh! Don't tell LLENN about this, okay!\r\nHere. That's to sweeten the deal.",
    "HDIvo_0166_0040": "My lips are sealed.",
    "HDIvo_0167_0000": "You're a decent shot, Death Gun. So I've got a proposal for ya!\r\nWanna squad up?",
    "HDIvo_0167_0010": "Out of the question.",
    "HDIvo_0167_0020": "Aww! Why not? It'd be fun!",
    "HDIvo_0168_0000": "Hey, Yuna! Will you sing a song if I join in?",
    "HDIvo_0168_0010": "Okay!",
    "HDIvo_0168_0020": "All right! Let's get those grenades bouncin' and blastin'!",
    "HDIvo_0168_0030": "You're not going to blow up the cabin, are you?",
    "HDIvo_0169_0000": "You seem calm despite the situation.",
    "HDIvo_0169_0010": "This is what I live for!\r\nI'm making so many interesting friends and memories! It's amazing!",
    "HDIvo_0169_0020": "I see \"calm\" was the wrong word.",
    "HDIvo_0170_0000": "No throne! No proper pomp!\r\nWhy must I deign to suffer in this dilapidated shack!",
    "HDIvo_0170_0010": "You seem awfully cozy for all your grumbling.\r\nOh I know, you're dying for some spice in life, eh?",
    "HDIvo_0170_0020": "Wh-What is that grenade for?\r\nAre you threatening me?",
    "HDIvo_0171_0000": "You'd definitely top the leaderboard if you came to GGO, Quinella.",
    "HDIvo_0171_0010": "Hehe! I'll show whatever world I find myself in exactly what I'm capable of.",
    "HDIvo_0171_0020": "I'd like to see you and Pitohui go at it.",
    "HDIvo_0172_0000": "You named your weapons, didn't you Fukaziroh?",
    "HDIvo_0172_0010": "You mean Rightony and Leftania? Cute, aren't they?",
    "HDIvo_0172_0020": "Rightony and Leftania. How nice! Which one is Rightony?",
    "HDIvo_0172_0030": "Well, the one on the—Hold up. Was it this one? Uh, oh well!\r\nWhichever one is in my right hand is Rightony!",
    "HDIvo_0173_0000": "This world is full of so many strange things.",
    "HDIvo_0173_0010": "I'm shocked, too.\r\nThe weapons, the tools, and the fighting styles are so new and refreshing.",
    "HDIvo_0173_0020": "It's a good opportunity to learn.\r\nKirito will likely share some tips if we ask.",
    "HDIvo_0173_0030": "Good point.\r\nLet's have him give us an introduction to the ins and outs of this world.",
    "HDIvo_0174_0000": "I am fascinated by your talent in swordfighting and excellent judgment.",
    "HDIvo_0174_0010": "I appreciate the compliment, but I would like not being treated as a subject for\r\nobservation.",
    "HDIvo_0174_0020": "My apologies.\r\nI have a habit of becoming absorbed in that which captures my interest.",
    "HDIvo_0174_0030": "So, it's a regular thing for you?\r\nWhat a curious man you are.",
    "HDIvo_0175_0000": "Why don't you rest? You'll find yourself unable to fight at a crucial moment\r\nif you're constantly straining yourself.",
    "HDIvo_0175_0010": "Heh, don't worry about me.\r\nI'm only trying to decide which one of you to pick off first.",
    "HDIvo_0175_0020": "You're wasting your time.\r\nNone of us are so weak as to become your prey.",
    "HDIvo_0176_0000": "Your music puts my heart at ease.\r\nI would have liked Amayori to hear it.",
    "HDIvo_0176_0010": "Is that a friend of yours?\r\nI'll do a show in your world when I get the chance, so tell your friends!",
    "HDIvo_0177_0000": "It's plain to see that you and Yuna make an excellent team.",
    "HDIvo_0177_0010": "She's precious to me. I'll always have her back.",
    "HDIvo_0177_0020": "Having someone who will look out for you is a wonderful thing.\r\nI know very well two can do what one cannot.",
    "HDIvo_0178_0000": "My body seems to be getting a bit stiff. Oberon, you will spar with me.\r\nNo arguments.",
    "HDIvo_0178_0010": "Absolutely n—HEEE?! Why are you drawing your sword already?",
    "HDIvo_0178_0020": "No arguments.",
    "HDIvo_0178_0030": "O-Of course. A king must be generous.\r\nConsider this a great honor and privilege! ...Crap.",
    "HDIvo_0179_0000": "You never lose your composure even in times of crisis.\r\nProof of my unfailing judgment.",
    "HDIvo_0179_0010": "I have Kirito. No matter how strange a world I'm in,\r\nI'll have the strength to fight if he is with me.",
    "HDIvo_0179_0020": "Is that so?\r\nI believe I may be feeling a bit jealous.",
    "HDIvo_0180_0000": "I can't help but worry when I see you fighting in such a dangerous place.",
    "HDIvo_0180_0010": "I'll be okay as long as I'm with Daddy!\r\nHe'll protect me no matter what!",
    "HDIvo_0180_0020": "That does allay my concerns.\r\nI see they were unfounded.",
    "HDIvo_0181_0000": "Would you help me train, Heathcliff?",
    "HDIvo_0181_0010": "I would be happy to. Don't expect me to go easy on you, however.",
    "HDIvo_0181_0020": "Of course not!\r\nWow, I can't believe I actually get to train with the creator of Aincrad Style!",
    "HDIvo_0182_0000": "Hey Death Gun, why don't you take off your mask when you rest?\r\nIt must be stuffy in there.",
    "HDIvo_0182_0010": "Take off my mask? Don't be ridiculous. This is my true form.",
    "HDIvo_0182_0020": "Oh. I'm sorry I brought it up. Come to think of it, Fanatio used to hide her face.\r\nI guess everyone has their reasons.",
    "HDIvo_0183_0000": "Hey, Eugeo! Can you do that fancy ice move here?",
    "HDIvo_0183_0010": "My Release Recollection? That's only for battle. It would be dangerous to do here.",
    "HDIvo_0183_0020": "Oh, right. Too bad!\r\nI thought a stage made of ice would be a fun idea!",
    "HDIvo_0184_0000": "You and Yuna seem very close.",
    "HDIvo_0184_0010": "We have been together for a long time.",
    "HDIvo_0184_0020": "Kirito helped me through a lot in the same way.\r\nHaving someone you can trust and depend on is a wonderful thing.",
    "HDIvo_0185_0000": "I am a king, confound it! Why must I listen to these peasants?\r\nYou! What do you make of this?",
    "HDIvo_0185_0010": "Me? I think people would naturally follow you if you acted in a way\r\nthat was worthy of their respect.",
    "HDIvo_0185_0020": "Hmph. \"Respect.\" Such a vague and cliché notion.\r\nBut I will entertain your suggestion. What would you have me do then?",
    "HDIvo_0185_0030": "Let's see.\r\nYou could take the initiative in battle or protect others.",
    "HDIvo_0185_0040": "Do you hear your own madness, boy? Such treacherous acts are not fit for a king!\r\nThis is why I despise you plebeians.",
    "HDIvo_0185_0050": "And this is why no one respects you.",
    "HDIvo_0186_0000": "Eugeo, what have I done to earn such a scornful look?\r\nI am merely resting.",
    "HDIvo_0186_0010": "Administrator, I won't allow you to harm anyone here.\r\nTry anything and you will regret it.",

Life Burst zeroes out incoming damage, but slowly drains her HP, making it useful for neutralizing big hits or to control her HP. She recovers the HP lost with this effect once the effect is removed, so be sure the coast is clear before canceling it.",
    "HelpText_8_1": "Argo has quick-hitting attacks and great freedom of movement.\r\nUse her speed to facilitate hit-and-run tactics. She can also\r\ndouble-jump, enabling her to engage airborne enemies or make an\r\nemergency getaway. Her Advanced Skill, Deadly Pierce, is her main\r\nsource of damage, so try to attack enemies from behind for a\r\ndamage bonus.\r\n\r\nHer Unique Skill, Risky Stealth, renders her transparent and less\r\nlikely to be targeted by enemies. Activating this defense-oriented\r\nskill also cancels the previous action and makes her\r\nmomentarily impervious.\r\n\r\nHer Ultimate, Banishing Scratch, is an area attack that targets\r\nsurrounding enemies, allowing her to deal serious damage by diving\r\ninto a mob.",
    "HelpText_9_1": "Klein is an all-rounder who can flip between fighting stances with his Unique Skill, Fuurinkazan. His versatility makes him a great pick for beginners.\r\n\r\nThe Rin Stance grants a health recovery effect, which is a safe option until you get more comfortable using him. In the Ka Stance, he takes more damage, but gains an Attack boost. Learning to fight in this stance for extended periods will pay dividends in damage over time.\r\n\r\nFor Advanced Skills, he can chain a stun-inflicting Gengetsu into a charged up Zekkuu for a powerful combo.\r\n\r\nHis Ultimate, Sanka, is a compact, easy-to-use combo that can exploit even the smallest openings.",

    "evo0539_0010": "To think we would meet in\r\na place like this.",
    "evo0539_0020": "We can take it out\r\nif we combine our strength!",

    "evo0642_0350": "Pretty sure I found the objective!\r\nOkay, here I go!",
    "evo0642_0360": "All I gotta do is wreck that thing?\r\nOn it!",
    "evo0642_0370": "If I destroy that, we're good, right?!\r\nLeave it to me!",
    "evo0642_0380": "That thing's the target, huh?!\r\nI'll handle it!",
    "evo0642_0390": "Is that the target?\r\nLet me take it out!",
    "evo0642_0400": "So I just blow that thing to oblivion,\r\nright?! I got it covered!",
    "evo0642_0410": "I need only destroy that thing, yes?\r\nVery well! Here I come!",
    "evo0642_0420": "Just have to destroy that, right?\r\nThen, I hope it's ready for me!",
    "evo0642_0430": "The target is clear.\r\nAllow me.",
    "evo0642_0440": "Hmph. I don't take orders.",
    "evo0642_0450": "Aim for that thing, right?!\r\nGotcha! I'm on it!",

    "evo0642_0470": "I'll take care of this myself.\r\nLeave it to me!",
    "evo0642_0480": "Far from a worthy opponent for me,\r\nbut oh, all right.",
    "evo0642_0490": "That's the target, correct?!\r\nHere I go!",
    "evo0642_0600": "I destroyed it!\r\nGo get the others, please!",

    "evo0642_0750": "I guess I took it out somehow.\r\nPlease, handle the rest!",
    "evo0642_0760": "Took down my target!\r\nYou'll have to deal with the others!",
    "evo0642_0770": "I've done my part.\r\nDo with the rest what you will.",
    "evo0642_0780": "That was much too easy.\r\nYou can handle the rest.",

    "mv_AL_E_MAIN_261_006": "Heh... Such nonsense. You're such a gullible optimist.",
    "mv_AL_E_MAIN_261_007": "I don't believe I'm free of sin, but I've decided to fight along with you.",
    "mv_AL_E_MAIN_261_008": "Whatever lies ahead, I won't waver.",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_010_014": "Of course. What do you think I've been doing this whole time?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_010_015": "No matter what happens, I'll always rush to your side.",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_000": "Wh-What are you doing?! Cease this tomfoolery at once!",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_001": "There you go! How's the view up there?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_002": "Put me down this instant! I am not a child!",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_003": "I know you aren't. Relax.",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_006": "See? I knew you'd appreciate the view. Just enjoy the show to your heart's content. Okay?",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_013": "Yes.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_020_014": "I spent 200 years in solitude before I met you. I'd never touched another person.",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_040_014": "All right, let me find the spot on the fifth vertebra of your spine here...",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_040_015": "Huh? Is there a pressure point there?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_040_016": "Um, yeah! It'll make your back less stiff.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_040_017": "Pressure point located! Here goes!",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_040_018": "(That... feels weird, like her finger's digging between my muscle and joint.\r\nOw!)",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_050_012": "Okay, I'm trying! You don't have to move, but at least loosen your grip!",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_050_013": "There! I got rid of it! Everything's fine now.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_050_014": "*sob*... Are you sure?",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_001": "I'm holding you close to warm you up, of course.\r\nSkin contact is the best for that.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_002": "But why'd you take off your armor?!",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_003": "Armor is made of cold metal. That wouldn't warm you up at all.",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_011": "I'm sorry. I'm not trying to tease you. I wanted to return the warmth\r\nyou gave me.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_012": "You mean...",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_013": "Yes. I had foregone my womanhood to fight, but I was always so alone.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_014": "I'd sealed up all my emotions. Even the love I'd felt for decades.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_015": "Love?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_016": "Yes. Unrequited, but still love.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_017": "I see. Is that why you kept your hair and makeup so nice under your helmet?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_018": "Yes. But he never wanted anything more than my strength in battle.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_019": "(Strength in battle? Does that mean she's talking about another knight?)",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_020": "But you treated me like the human I am, and melted my frozen heart.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_021": "When I realized how I'd been imprisoned, even the pain melted away.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_120_022": "So I changed. I can fight now, unashamed of being a woman. I can live honestly.",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_001": "What is it?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_002": "Um... why have you been looking at my face so closely?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_003": "No reason. I'm simply monitoring your condition.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_004": "My condition, huh? It's just regular old paralysis, though.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_005": "The poison may have latent effects, so I'm observing you closely.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_006": "Oh, okay... If you say so.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_007": "Indeed... That's all it is, nothing more.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_008": "More importantly, you noticed the change in my mood.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_009": "You were clearly upset about something, and even looked a little bummed out.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_010": "Also, when we were assigned together, you kind of made a scene about it...",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_011": "True... I hesitated on going with you today, but had to because it was my duty.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_012": "So, you were mad at me after all?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_013": "Not necessarily.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_014": "Then why the cold shoulder?",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_015": "I...",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_016": "I no longer know how I should interact with you.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_017": "Or perhaps... getting closer to you is frightening.",
    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_130_018": "Frightening?",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_140_009": "N-No. I didn't say anything even close to that, did I?",

    "mv_AL_E_SUBEV_140_011": "Barging into a girl's room...\r\nWhat happened to \"courtesy even between friends\"?!",

    "mv_AL_E_SUB_180_000": "Well, whatever.\r\nWe did great today. And it's all thanks to you and your whip.",

    "mv_AL_MAIN_230_000": "Yes. She is merely in a deep sleep waiting for the savior's rescue.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_230_001": "The savior's rescue?",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_230_002": "Of course. Now then, I will show you the truth using Post-Cognition.",

    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_003": "You're the one who said I should ask the questions. And we saw that cat a lot.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_004": "Yeah, we did, but... Oh well, I was already full anyway.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_005": "This really isn't like you.",

    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_010": "I remember camping out with you like this the first time we met.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_011": "You're right. It feels like ages ago.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_012": "You were so guarded back then. You seemed to hate me at first sight!",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_013": "I didn't hate you.\r\nI just thought you were weird, nosy, naive, and overly familiar.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_014": "Wow, I'm not sure which is worse.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_015": "Haha! Well, I don't feel that way now. You'll have to forgive my past self.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_016": "Besides... back then, I had put a wall up when I was around other people.",
    "mv_AL_MAIN_270_017": "But thanks to you, Eugeo, Alice, Asuna, and the others, that wall's crumbled.",

    "mv_AL_SUB_150_000": "I'd like to tell you a story.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_001": "A story of a hero who fought by our side until the very end.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_002": "As a strong young girl, she practiced swordcraft with her beloved father.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_003": "She had a dream.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_004": "A dream to live an honest life. To be strong, just, and proud.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_005": "However, the world around her was unkind and wore her down.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_006": "Time and time again, cruel people trampled on her dream.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_006_1": "Some called her a defect out of prejudice.\r\nOthers envied her purity and scorned her.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_007": "Defect?! Isn't she talking about Orthinanos?",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_008": "What use is there talking about that defect?! She's no hero! That's nonsense!",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_009": "Even when those people treated her with such cruelty, she stayed her course.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_010": "Even when cursed and belittled, she kept her pride, her faith, and her passion.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_011": "Just like the lycoris her ancestors guarded in that barren land.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_012": "On her journey she found friends. Laughed. Cried. Sometimes even fought.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_013": "She made irreplaceable memories. Touched so many with the light in her heart.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_014": "And...",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_015": "She gave her light, the flame in her soul, to become the blade of salvation.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_016": "We accepted her will and together we released the world from darkness!",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_017": "Although her life is lost, her flame will not die. It burns on within us.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_018": "We will never forget. Her passion. Her pride. The time we spent together.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_019": "I have a request for you all.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_020": "I would like you all to remember the girl who became your savior.",
    "mv_AL_SUB_150_021": "Her name is...",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_000": "Haaah...",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_001": "What's with the long sigh? Something wrong?",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_002": "There is little I can do to help if your soul has not fully recovered.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_003": "I have far fewer memories with you than Asuna or the others from The Real World.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_004": "What about that time we climbed Central Cathedral's outer wall?",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_005": "Now that's something I'll never forget.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_006": "Oh, so you remember that?",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_007": "You bet I do. I remember your skinny little legs shaking like a calf's, Alice.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_008": "You seem to recall some unnecessary details. Allow me to help clear your head.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_009": "Wh-Whoa, you're scaring me.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_010": "Only because you insist on mocking me.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_011": "My bad. I didn't mean to make you mad.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_012": "If I recall correctly, you were also quite disrespectful when we first met.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_013": "\"Idiot,\" you called me, again and again and again...",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_014": "That's because you were trying to jump off the tower.\r\nI didn't want to watch you die.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_015": "Your judgment was ultimately correct, but that does not excuse your insults.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_016": "Guh...",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_017": "I'll have you know that I have much more to say about that incident.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_018": "Seriously?! All right, then, hit me with everything you've got.",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_019": "That I shall. Let us see... While we were climbing the tower walls...",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_020": "Hehe...",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_021": "Wh-What are you smirking about?",
    "mv_AL_S_ALICE_100_022": "I-I am doing no such thing! I merely found the thought curious...",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_000": "Zzz... zzz...",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_001": "Heehee!",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_002": "Ah!",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_003": "Good morning, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_004": "Sorry, I must've fallen asleep. I was looking forward to talking with you...",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_005": "No, it's fine. You were tired.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_006": "Hmhmhm.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_007": "What are you laughing about, Asuna?",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_008": "Oh, it's just, being here with you reminds me of the old days.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_009": "You know, back in SAO, when I was a clearer on the front lines.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_010": "I remember you watching over me when I took a nap in a field.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_011": "Oh yeah, I remember that.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_012": "Good. I'm glad you haven't forgotten.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_013": "How could I ever forget? I was the one who invited you out to take that nap.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_014": "Even if the place was safe from monster attacks, I wasn't \r\nabout to let a girl sleep out in the open.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_015": "Yeah. If you valued your life, you couldn't let your guard down for a second.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_016": "I doubt I'll ever forget the sight of your sleeping face on that day, Asuna.",
    "mv_AL_S_ASUNA_100_017": "The vice commander of the great Knights of the Blood Oath, completely defenseless.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_000": "Now then, Kirito. Let us begin reviewing your memories.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_001": "Thanks for your help. But are you sure you've got the time? Aren't you busy?",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_002": "I bear some responsibility for your injury, Kirito. It's the least I can do.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_003": "All right, I suppose I trust your judgment. Thanks, Cardinal.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_004": "I shall begin, then, by talking about what I saw of you through Charlotte.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_005": "She's spent more time with you than I have, after all...",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_006": "Got it. Go ahead.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_007": "Right, then. Let us begin around the time you departed from Rulid.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_008": "That's more than two years ago. It's no wonder I don't remember much from then.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_009": "Hmph, a mere two years. Given your erraticism, I can recall them in detail.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_010": "P-Please go easy on me.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_011": "First, tell me the names of the twins who helped you at Walde Farm.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_012": "I remember that! Telure and Teline, right?",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_013": "Indeed. You managed to tell the two apart, even when they traded ribbons.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_014": "So you were even watching that, huh...",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_015": "I was investigating your true nature,\r\nso I was sure to observe you carefully indeed.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_016": "And when I did, it was my first taste of hope in quite some time.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_017": "Hope... It's kinda embarrassing when you say it like that.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_018": "No need for modesty, Kirito. Your actions have proven you worthy of the word.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_019": "Really?",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_020": "Indeed. I'd intended to rescue you to prevent you from being synthesized...",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_021": "However, you escaped, and I met you much further downstairs than I expected.",
    "mv_AL_S_CARDINAL_100_022": "Of all the units in Underworld, you least abide by my predictions.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_000": "It feels like it's been ages since we last slept in the same place.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_001": "Yeah, it really does.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_002": "We used to share a bed every night back then...",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_003": "When we were on the road to Zakkaria and working at the Waldes' farm, I mean.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_004": "Those were some good times, huh?",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_005": "Oh, right, I'm supposed to make sure you're not forgetting anything, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_006": "Okay, I'll start you off easy. Do you remember this?",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_007": "Remember what, exactly?",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_008": "When we used to sleep side-by-side like this,",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_009": "You always rolled around like crazy, and I'd wake up with your feet in my face.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_010": "That... doesn't sound right.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_011": "It is. Try to think back.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_012": "The second set of legs on me usually made me feel extra sluggish in the morning.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_013": "Hm, can't say I remember that.\r\nSure you're not the one with memory issues, Eugeo?",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_014": "It almost sounds like you've got a bone to pick with me, going right for that.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_015": "No, no, of course not.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_016": "It's just, you already talked about our time at Walde Farm.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_017": "And it sounds like you remember the Swordfighting Tournament in Zakkaria too.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_018": "That's why I brought up something more obscure.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_019": "You're playing hardball tonight.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_020": "The way I remember it, you were the one always tossing and turning.",
    "mv_AL_S_EUGEO_100_021": "No, no, of course not.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_000": "Let's relax, why don't we, my boy?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_001": "Y-Yeah, sure...",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_002": "Fate is a fickle mistress.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_003": "Why wouldn't it be?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_004": "I never would have expected to end up here after trying to kill you.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_005": "I'm just as surprised as you. Hell, until we fought, I assumed you were a man.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_006": "Ah, yes. I'm glad you brought that up.\r\nI still have my suspicions about you, boy.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_007": "Huh? What do you mean?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_008": "You didn't spare me because I was a woman, did you?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_009": "Would you have done the same if I were a man?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_010": "Of course! Guy or girl, I would've saved you either way, Fanatio!",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_011": "Your panicking only raises my suspicions.\r\nIt would explain much about you, though.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_012": "Such as why your peers seem to be largely comprised of women.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_013": "Y-You saying I prioritize saving girls?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_014": "It is a definite possibility based on what I've observed.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_015": "Guess I'll take that as a yes...",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_016": "After you help a woman, do you demand any sort of reward for your efforts?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_017": "Of course not... Can't you have a little faith?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_018": "Well, that's good to hear, at least. Hehe.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_019": "Listen, I didn't want you to die because I admired your spirit.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_020": "When we crossed blades, I felt it firsthand.",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_021": "...Is that so?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_022": "Wh-What is it?",
    "mv_AL_S_FANATIO_100_023": "Oh, relax. I'm not going to chew your head off. That was a pleased reaction.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_000": "Whoa there, what are you talking about? You're still our prey, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_001": "Huh?",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_002": "Oh?",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_003": "Did you actually think things had changed?",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_004": "O-Of course! I'm working with the Integrity Knights!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_005": "That does not change our relationship.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_006": "Ohh, don't tell me you've forgotten, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_007": "I guess it's true that your memory isn't all back!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_008": "I didn't forget anything! You're making this all up!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_009": "That's what you think. We'll just have to remind him of the truth, Nel!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_010": "That we shall, Zel.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_011": "Wh-What are you doing, Linel?",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_012": "Why, I'm restraining your arms so you cannot move.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_013": "Yes, but why—Hold on!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_014": "Heh heh heh heh...",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_015": "Hehehehe...",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_016": "What are you two doing?! Let me go, Linel!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_017": "I will not.",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_018": "Like we said, you're still our prey, Kirito!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_019": "Now, brace yourself for death by tickles!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_020": "S-Stop that! Ahah! Ahahahaha!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_021": "You would do best to stop struggling!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_022": "Tickle, tickle, tickle!",
    "mv_AL_S_FIZEL_100_023": "Ahahaha! I-I'm going to die!",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_000": "Hmmm...",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_001": "What's wrong? Can't sleep?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_002": "Yeah, I'm too awake.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_003": "Wanna talk until you can fall asleep, then?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_004": "That sounds nice. Tell me about your time in this world.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_005": "Um... well, how about the time I entered the Zakkaria Sword Arts Tournament?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_006": "You were in a sword fighting tournament?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_007": "Yeah, but it was more a demonstration of skill rather than a crossing\r\nof swords...",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_008": "A demonstration of skill...\r\nI can't even picture you doing that. Did you manage it?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_009": "I just swung my sword faster than everyone else.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_010": "I figured it would distract the judges if I had a finger out of place\r\nor something.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_011": "Hahaha...\r\nI figured you wouldn't have given them some ordinary show of skill.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_012": "I got pretty into it! Eugeo got mad at me, though.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_013": "Heheheheh...",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_014": "What's wrong?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_015": "Nothing, it's just that I'm really not getting lulled to sleep like this.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_016": "Oh, right, we started talking to help you get to sleep! Sorry about that.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_017": "No need to apologize. This used to happen in the past too.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_018": "Did it?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_019": "Yeah. You don't remember?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_020": "Back when we were kids, you used to talk to me like this\r\nwhenever I couldn't sleep.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_021": "Now that you mention it, I remember you always managed to keep me talking late.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_022": "Did that ever end up putting you to sleep?",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_023": "Hmm, I can't say for sure, but... I don't think so.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_024": "No matter how much we talked, we'd never run out of things to say.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_025": "We are siblings, after all.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_026": "It wasn't all fun, though. We fought a lot too.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_027": "Of course I remember the fights.\r\nCan't say I remember what they were about, though.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_027_1": "Probably just stupid little things...",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_028": "I remember some of them! Um, like the one time you ate my pudding.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_029": "So yeah, stupid little things, then.",
    "mv_AL_S_LEAFA_100_030": "Haha, you're right. But it was a big deal to me at the time.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_000": "...then I used Snakebite, which helped me beat Egome.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_001": "Fascinating.\r\nIt's just like you to beat a guy whose sword Priority is above yours.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_002": "You think so? I was sweating bullets the whole time.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_003": "Psh. Please. I'm sure you had a smug look on your face when you cut him down.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_004": "Not a chance. My admission to the Academy was on the line. I couldn't get cocky.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_005": "I didn't want to blow my best chance of making contact with The Real World.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_006": "All right, I buy that... Man, your stories are the best, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_007": "You really think so?",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_008": "I do. So tell me more. Who else have you fought? How'd they go?",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_009": "Let's see.\r\nWhen I was a Primary Trainee at the Academy, I went at it with a noble...",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_010": "(Huh? Did I pass out?)",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_011": "Ahh, I feel great.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_012": "Oh...",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_013": "L-Liz?!",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_014": "You're awake...",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_015": "(Wh-Why's she inspecting my face?!)",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_016": "Y-You're a little close right now...",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_017": "O-Oh, sorry.\r\nIt's been a while since I last saw you sleeping, so it was an accident.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_018": "Er, well.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_019": "Also, I was starting to feel a little lonely.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_020": "You were?",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_021": "Yeah, thanks to all your war stories.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_022": "They made me realize how much you've grown, how much you'd seen without me.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_023": "I don't think I've really grown that much.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_024": "Though, if you count the time I've spent in here, I'm the older one now.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_025": "Hehe. You have grown. Both physically and mentally.",
    "mv_AL_S_LISBETH_100_026": "The one thing that hasn't changed is how cute you look when you're asleep.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_000": "Hmmm...",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_001": "What is it?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_002": "Why do you always look so... content?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_003": "Does this situation not bother you?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_004": "Now that you mention it, it is a little weird to be lying facing you like this.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_005": "But you're the one who took my invitation.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_006": "I simply came to talk about our memories. That's all.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_007": "I never thought we'd wind up like this!",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_008": "Sorry. At any rate, we shouldn't think about it too hard.\r\nLet's talk like normal.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_009": "I don't think that's going to work.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_010": "Still, as long as we're here... How can we make this less awkward?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_011": "Let's see...",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_012": "What about closing your eyes? You won't have to look at me.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_013": "Not exactly elegant... but I'll try.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_014": "Is it working?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_015": "Yes, I think I can talk like this.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_016": "Glad to hear it.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_017": "It bothers me, though... Why aren't you nervous?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_018": "Oh, no no, I am.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_019": "Pfft, that's so convincing.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_020": "I really am!",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_021": "But seeing you so nervous kind of calms me down.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_022": "Wh-What do you mean by that?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_023": "Haha.",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_024": "What's so funny?",
    "mv_AL_S_MEDINA_100_025": "Tensing up, calming down. Freaking out. It's fun watching you react.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_000": "Aw...",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_001": "Ronie? What's up? You look spaced out.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_002": "Huh? Oh! Sorry! Don't worry about me!",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_003": "I know I'm not worthy of the task, but I'm here to help you with your memory!",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_004": "Oh, sure. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but you don't need to be so nervous.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_005": "Thank you for your concern! But I intend to do my very best to help you!",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_006": "N-Now then, let's begin! Tell me if you remember what I'm talking about!",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_007": "Okay, sure thing. Thanks.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_008": "Just leave it to me. First of all... Err...",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_009": "You always used to bring me honey pies. They were really delicious.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_010": "Oh yeah, those were good. Especially the ones from the Jumping Deer.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_011": "Primary Trainees could only go out on weekends, so I always appreciated that.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_012": "I remember wishing I could have more of those when I was a Primary Trainee.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_013": "That was why I tried to help you. Plus, I wanted some myself.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_014": "You really are kind, Kirito. Sometimes you even brought me two pies.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_015": "That was 'cause I got stuff on sale and had some spare shia, I think.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_016": "Yes, that's correct. And once, you even bought three pies per person.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_017": "Oh, yeah. That did happen. I was surprised Eugeo allowed it.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_018": "Um, and you always waited for us to get back before eating any.",
    "mv_AL_S_RONYE_100_019": "Only 'cause the Primary Trainees have such a strict curfew.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_000": "How strange...",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_001": "Oh? What's strange now?",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_002": "Being here like this with you. That's very strange.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_003": "True, and we only just met. If you don't want to do this, don't force yourself.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_004": "It's fine. I'm not opposed to it.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_005": "Oh... That's good, then.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_006": "I thought it might be interesting to speak with you more.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_007": "Oh, yeah?",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_008": "I thought so when I saw the way you fight.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_009": "I don't understand the feeling it inspired in me, but I knew I wanted\r\nto talk to you.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_010": "Sheyta... Yeah, I wanted to talk to you like this too.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_011": "You did?",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_012": "Yeah, I really did.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_013": "I was... someone who cut all who opposed me... That was all.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_014": "But when talking to you, I realized I felt more toward you than simply cutting.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_015": "Maybe you trust me or something? I mean, I'd be happy if that were it!",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_016": "Trust... Yes, perhaps so.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_017": "But what about you?",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_018": "I avoid interaction with my fellow Knights, hence my title of the Silent One.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_019": "I avoid them because all who face me I will inevitably cut...",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_020": "Does that not frighten you?",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_021": "Nah, I'm not scared.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_022": "Why?",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_023": "Because if you really wanted to cut me, you'd have done it already.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_024": "And you haven't, so I'm taking that to mean you don't really want to cut me.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_025": "Besides, I know you're someone I can trust to talk to like this. I'm not afraid.",
    "mv_AL_S_SCHETA_100_026": "I see... You're quite the strange one.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_000": "...",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_001": "...",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_002": "...",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_003": "(Man, this silence is killing me... Gotta come up with something to say.)",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_004": "S-Sure feels nice to kick back and relax, huh?",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_005": "Y-Yes, it does.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_006": "A-Ahaha...",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_007": "...",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_008": "...",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_009": "(Swing and a miss. Come on, Selka, loosen up!)",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_010": "Sorry I'm not very talkative.\r\nI've never slept with a boy before, so I'm nervous.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_011": "Oh, is that it? It's fine, don't push yourself if you're not comfortable.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_012": "No. I still need to check up on your memories.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_013": "I'll do my best to calm my nerves, so you do your best to remember correctly.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_014": "Sounds good. So, what exactly do you want me to remember?",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_015": "Oh, let's see... Tell me about the time we first met.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_016": "When I first met you, Selka... I thought, wow, what a little girl.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_017": "That was the first thing you thought?",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_018": "Well, I mean, I was impressed a girl so small was studying the Sacred Arts.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_019": "You're still calling me little.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_020": "I, uh, y'know... I don't think you're all that little anymore.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_021": "That doesn't make me feel any better.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_022": "Talking to you reminds me of back then. It was a big surprise when you showed up.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_023": "What do you mean?",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_024": "I never thought I would meet a Lost Child of Vecta.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_025": "It almost seemed like you came from a different world, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_SELKA_100_026": "Y-You know that's not possible!",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_000": "I really appreciate your help, Silica. Otherwise, it wouldn't have gone so well.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_001": "Really?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_002": "Yes, really.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_003": "That's good to hear.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_004": "Well, time to get some shut-eye.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_005": "Wait, not yet.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_006": "Why not?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_007": "You, um... You need to get under the blanket!",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_008": "Oh, uh, okay...",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_009": "There, I'm under it now.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_010": "Good! We can't have you getting cold.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_011": "Yep, that'd be real bad.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_012": "Hey, um, Kirito?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_013": "Hmm? What?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_014": "Are you, um... Are you thirsty?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_015": "Huh? No, I'm fine.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_016": "That's good. It's hard to sleep when you're thirsty.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_017": "Is... that so...",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_018": "Well, sleep tight. You need to be up bright and early.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_019": "Hey, Silica?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_020": "What is it?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_021": "You seem... a bit off tonight. I'm not just imagining that, right?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_022": "Y-You think so?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_023": "Yeah, you're a lot more, I guess, on the ball than usual?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_024": "Yeah, I'm definitely not a responsible person, huh?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_025": "Erm, that's not what I meant. Sorry.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_026": "I'm just worried, okay? You seem different.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_027": "I can't keep anything from you, can I?",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_028": "I realized something when we were going over our shared memories.",
    "mv_AL_S_SILICA_100_029": "I'm always just relying on you for help.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_000": "*sigh*",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_001": "Sinon? What's wrong?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_002": "Ah! Oh, it's nothing, really.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_003": "Really? It seemed like you were lost in thought for a while there.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_004": "R-Really?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_005": "Yeah. You all right?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_006": "I feel like you've been avoiding eye contact with me too...",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_007": "It's just... it doesn't feel right.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_008": "What doesn't? Do you have a tummy ache?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_009": "*sigh*... Why are you like this?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_010": "What?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_011": "Things don't feel right because you're acting differently.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_012": "How so?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_013": "It's... In this world, you look much more like a man than usual, that's all.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_014": "Uhh, biologically speaking, I AM a man.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_015": "That's not what I mean...",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_016": "I'm talking about your face, your build. You follow?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_017": "Your game avatar and Real World appearance are both fairly feminine, right?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_018": "I mean, I do hear that a lot, I guess...",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_019": "But here, and maybe it's because you're around 19 in this world.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_020": "Your face is more mature, you're taller,\r\nand your build is more like an adult male.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_021": "So... it doesn't quite feel like it's you, and that somehow makes me nervous.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_022": "Is it really that different?\r\nMy face is the same here as in The Real World, right?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_023": "It is, but you're still not the same. Growing two cen is cheating.",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_024": "What? How is that cheating?",
    "mv_AL_S_SINON_100_025": "It's the very definition of cheating, Kirito.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_000": "Hehe...",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_001": "Uh... Do you have to stare at me like that, Liena?",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_002": "What, are you getting flustered, Kirito? I thought you were tougher than that.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_003": "What kind of person do you think I am?",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_004": "My bad. I'm half-joking. And half-serious, too.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_005": "I feel an indescribable sense of warmth when I'm alone with you.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_006": "Please... Are you trying to embarrass me?",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_007": "Oh, fine, I'll stop. Now, to the matter at hand. Let's verify your memories.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_008": "P-Please go easy on me.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_009": "Of course I will. This is only our first session.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_010": "Do you remember why I made you my page? And I won't take no for an answer.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_011": "Of course. It was because I used a unique style that was like your Serlut Style.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_012": "My Aincrad Style uses a lot of the same movements as yours.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_013": "Well, you're mostly correct. I never did tell you more than that.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_014": "Huh? Did I forget something? Sorry...",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_015": "No, really, it's fine. It's my fault for assuming you understood.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_016": "Don't say that. You're making it seem like I let you down.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_017": "Give me a minute. I'll try to remember...",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_018": "*sigh* It's because I saw no doubt in your eyes when you used your sword.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_019": "Your style is unique,\r\nyet you don't feel inferior to those traditionally trained.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_020": "I couldn't help but wonder what made you so sure of yourself.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_021": "Oh, okay. Sorry I didn't remember.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_022": "I never told you in as many words, so there's no need to apologize.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_023": "I think I've been drawn to the strength of your will ever since I first saw you.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_024": "I hope that's clear enough now.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_025": "I think you're giving me too much credit. I'm nothing special.",
    "mv_AL_S_SORTILIENA_100_026": "Oh, but you are. It was your strength that freed me from my doubts.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_000": "I, Tiese Schtrinen, am here to help you review your memories, Kirito!",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_001": "Thanks, Tiese.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_002": "Let's get started.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_003": "Let's see. Do you remember when Ronie and I became pages for you guys?",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_004": "Of course I do.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_005": "Otherwise, I wouldn't know you at all.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_006": "Oh, good point. Sorry, that was a little too easy.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_007": "No need to apologize. I'm happy you're here to help.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_008": "Let's just keep at it.",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_009": "Sure thing. Hmm... Where to start...",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_010": "By the way, Tiese, what did you think when you became our pages?",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_011": "Oh, you want to know how I felt?",
    "mv_AL_S_TIESE_100_012": "Actually, I was a little worried about working with an older man.",

    "mv_FB_E_LISBETH_112_003": "What is it? Why are you acting all shy?",
    "mv_FB_E_LISBETH_112_004": "Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking it's a pretty bold outfit, is all...",
    "mv_FB_E_LISBETH_112_005": "Bold...?\r\nWhat?!",
    "mv_FB_E_LISBETH_112_006": "No, no, hold on. D-Did I really make something this revealing?",
    "mv_FB_E_LISBETH_112_007": "K-Kirito! Turn away! Don't look at me!",
    "mv_FB_E_LISBETH_112_008": "Y-You're the one who told me to look in the first place.",

    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_000": "Aww, Yui! You're adorable! It looks great on you!",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_001": "Thank you for the compliment, Silica. Your swimsuit looks lovely too.",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_002": "I never wear swimsuits. I feel awkward.",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_003": "You say that, but wowzers. You certainly picked a grown-up cut.\r\nWhat about you, Silica? Want to get adventurous?",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_004": "N-No thanks. Ahaha...\r\nLiz, you picked a very... bold outfit.",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_005": "Heh, you bet. We're just trying them on, so I thought \"why not?\"\r\nAnd just so we're clear: not trying to impress anyone in particular.",

    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_007": "Uh, no?!",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_008": "H-Hold up, Yui. Why would we go see Kirito?",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_009": "Because I sent him a message telling him we're trying on swimsuits,\r\nand he just has to come see!",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_010": "W-Wait, Kirito's here?!",
    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_011": "Of course! He messaged me back saying \"I can't wait to see everyone\r\nin their new swimsuits!\"",

    "mv_FB_E_MIZUGI_101_013": "S-Stop! Cancel! Abort! Yui, we're calling it all off!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_000": "Should we start with the herbal bath?",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_001": "You've got my vote! Whoa, look! The water's green! Crazy!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_002": "Yuuki, take it slow. No splashing, please.\r\n...Oooh, that's nice.",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_003": "Ahh, it really is. I just wish Liz and Silica could've made it.",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_004": "Yeah, but they had plans, and Sinonon was really busy too.\r\nLet's come back with everyone sometime.",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_005": "Agreed! How about after we beat a nasty boss, or after a huge event!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_006": "It'd be great to celebrate victory with a nice dip in the hot springs!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_007": "That's a great idea! Let's figure out the dates and make it happen!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_008": "I'll pack lunch for everyone!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_009": "It's not a picnic, Asuna.",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_010": "Oh yeah. I just love making lunch, ha ha.",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_011": "But a picnic sounds like a lot of fun too.\r\nWe can go out on a boss raid slash picnic slash hot spring vacation!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_012": "Ahaha, that sounds like a busy day!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_013": "So, when should we do this? Tomorrow? This weekend?",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_014": "Slow down, Yuuki! We don't have to rush it. Let's find out when everyone's free\r\nand pick a time that works for everyone.",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_015": "Fiiine. But I'm leaving all the planning to you, then!",
    "mv_FB_E_ONSEN_100_016": "Hehe, this is going to be fun!",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_000": "O-Oh. Okay...",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_001": "What do you think? It's not weird, is it...?",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_002": "N-No, it's definitely not weird.",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_003": "So, how do I look?",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_004": "Uh...",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_005": "Oh, come on! You're the one who said you wanted to see me try it on!\r\n...Do you think I look good in it?",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_006": "...I do. You look great.",
    "mv_FB_E_PHILIA_115_007": "Th-Thanks...",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_000": "...Oh, looks like it's just about done. Here you go, Premiere.",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_001": "*munch* *munch*... Oh, that's delicious!\r\nI'd never guess this was cooked just before it was about to go bad!",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_002": "Ha ha, when you put it that way, it does sound impressive.",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_003": "Mm... Tastes like it came out okay, too. I'm glad I brought some\r\nof Asuna's salt and pepper mix just in case.",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_004": "Now that you mention it, those are the only seasonings I can taste.\r\nAnd yet it's still so good...",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_005": "Didn't I tell you? A barbecue is more of a special event than a type of cooking.",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_006": "Eating while you're having a good time makes the food taste that much better.",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_007": "So, defeating that enemy with you and then cooking it together...\r\nAll of that goes into making this flavor?",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_008": "Well, I don't know if I'd go that far.",
    "mv_FB_E_PREMIERE_118_009": "Thank you, Kirito. This tastes really, really good.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_000": "A-All right, I'm done.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_001": "Wh-What do you think?",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_002": "Well, it definitely gives off a different impression.\r\nI'm not sure how best to describe it...",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_003": "Um...would you say I look...mature?",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_004": "Hmm, mature...\r\nWell, now that you mention it, I think yeah, you do look more mature.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_005": "R-Really?! You think I look mature?!",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_006": "I-I'll take it! This is what I want to look like from now on...",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_007": "Chiirp?",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_008": "Oh, sorry, Pina. Come on, you can get back on my head now.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_009": "Chiiirp...",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_010": "Huh? Pina, what's wrong?",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_011": "Pina seems upset about something.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_012": "Wait, do you not like this new hairstyle?\r\nOh no...",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_013": "Hahaha, I think Pina likes your old look better.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_014": "Y-You really think so...?",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_015": "Well, I have to agree that your old look was more... you.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_016": "Y-You do?",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_017": "Oh, don't get me wrong, you look good like this too,\r\nbut it just... seems off, or something.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_018": "I think that's probably what's bothering Pina too.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_019": "And with your new hairstyle, it looks like Pina isn't sure\r\nhow to rest on your head either.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_020": "Yeah, you're right...\r\nI guess I should really just be myself.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_021": "Absolutely. After all, your normal look is probably the cutest anyway.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_022": "Y-Y-You mean... you think I'm cute?!",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_023": "Chirp chirp chirp!",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_024": "Yeah, see? Even Pina agrees.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_025": "All right, then. I guess I'll give up on trying for a new look.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_026": "I'm sorry I took up your whole day like this.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_027": "Don't worry about it. I had a pretty good time too.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_028": "If you say so...\r\nThis did kind of end up being all about me, though...",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_029": "Don't worry about that. I figure since we're out shopping anyway,\r\nwe could take a look at some weapons they have for sale.",
    "mv_FB_E_SILICA_113_030": "S-Sure! I would love to go with you!",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_000": "Hehe, thanks. By the way, do you mind if I tell you something?",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_001": "Sure.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_002": "I may have said this before, but... until I came into the world of SAO,\r\nI was always alone.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_003": "But then I met you. I made friends I could trust.\r\nAll of a sudden, I started to feel like it was good to be alive too.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_004": "Sinon...",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_005": "And here, in the world of GGO, where guns rule, I want to grow.\r\nI want to go from being weak to being strong.\r\nI want to earn the right to be able to stand with you.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_006": "Because I believe that as long as I'm with you, Kirito,\r\ntogether we can overcome anything.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_007": "I think that's why I feel so safe right now,\r\neven though I know we're being hunted down.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_008": "But you don't need to earn any sort of right to stand with us.\r\nWe're with you because we all want to be with you. It's as simple as that.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_009": "I mean, look at me. You're saving me all the time. You saved me just now\r\nby forcing yourself to move, even though you were stunned.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_010": "...Thank you, Kirito. Hearing you say that makes me... happy.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_011": "That goes for both of us, then.",
    "mv_FB_E_SINON_111_012": "Yeah...",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_000": "Ta-da! Meet Strea, the Darling Dealer!\r\nWhat do you think, Kirito?",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_001": "W-Well...\r\nIt's, uh... It's something.",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_002": "Come on, tell me. Do you think it looks good on me?\r\nQuit looking away and focus on the outfit, would you?!",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_003": "Hey, talk about a daring outfit that girl over there is wearing.",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_004": "She's going to be the dealer? I think maybe I'll play a few hands.",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_005": "W-Well, she's certainly attracting attention...",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_006": "What was that? You think it does look good on me?",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_007": "Um, Strea... You're very attractive in that, but...\r\nDon't you think it's a little... too bold?",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_008": "Really? You think so?",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_009": "I mean, it does show off some skin, but... not any more than normal.\r\n...Wait, I know what this is.",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_010": "Wh-What do you mean?",
    "mv_FB_E_STREA_114_011": "You don't want other people to see me like this, do you?\r\nYou want to keep me all to yourself. Well, aren't you greedy!",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_000": "I've thought for a long time about how fun it'd be to go off\r\non one of these trips with everybody.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_001": "Getting excited making plans, figuring out our budget and when we can all\r\ntake time off and stuff...",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_002": "Of course, nobody would sleep the night before. How could they? And when\r\nthe big day finally comes, we'd be greeting each other as we rub our eyes awake.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_003": "All the lunches we'd have too...\r\nSometimes we'd make them, sometimes we'd eat in at a diner or something.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_004": "And then all the places we could go. Mountains and beaches and theme parks...\r\nReally, anywhere works as long as we're out on the open road!",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_005": "Ehehe... I feel like I've got a little taste for what that all must be like now\r\nthat I'm here holding onto your back, getting all shaken around.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_006": "This must be what it's like, right? After all, the wind's blowing in my face!",

    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_009": "Ahaha, I can't wait to ride one for real!\r\nI'm definitely going to practice until it's second nature!",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_071_010": "I'm going to make you so proud. Just you wait,\r\nI'm going to leave you in the dust with how good I'll be!",

    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_000": "...So I'm just like Yui or your sister.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_001": "Hmm?",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_002": "Oh, nothing.\r\nI was just thinking how Asuna would probably be upset if she saw us like this.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_003": "What? No way. She wouldn't get mad about me carrying you around on my back.\r\nI think she'd be more upset if I just left you there, exhausted.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_004": "I guess that's true.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_005": "...Um, Kirito?",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_006": "Hm?",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_007": "Your back is really warm.\r\nI wonder if this is what it feels like to have an older brother.",

    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_009": "...Okay. But I think I'd still get pretty embarrassed if anyone else saw us.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_010": "If you think you can walk, I could let you down before we get too close.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_011": "That sounds good.\r\n...Thanks, Kirito.",
    "mv_FB_E_YUUKI_117_012": "You're welcome.",
    "mv_FB_E_ZELISKA_093_000": "Still, isn't this armor a little overpowered? It doesn't have any of the\r\ndownsides that optical camo suits have. It's instant and complete invisibility.",

    "mv_FB_E_ZELISKA_120_002": "I did. I thought you might be too embarrassed to wear the outfit by yourself,\r\nso I bought enough materials to make one for every woman on the squad.",

    "mv_FB_E_ZELISKA_120_006": "I've heard that somewhere before...!",
    "mv_FB_E_ZELISKA_120_007": "Ha ha, wow! Didn't expect that random comment to come back around so soon!",
    "mv_FB_E_ZELISKA_120_008": "...",
    "mv_FB_E_ZELISKA_120_009": "Well, I thank you, Daisy. That goes for the rest of you too. You've made my day!",

    "mv_FB_S_ALICE_000_001": "I know it's hard, but try not to let it get to you.\r\nYou'll make it back one way or another. I'm sure of it.",
    "mv_FB_S_ALICE_000_002": "And until you do, my friends and I are here to help.\r\nI almost feel like it's fate that we got to meet again.",
    "mv_FB_S_ALICE_000_003": "Fate...?",
    "mv_FB_S_ALICE_000_004": "Hm, you may be right. I've wound up in a completely different world,\r\nyet to find you here of all places...",

    "mv_FB_S_ALICE_000_006": "Ah, don't yell out of the blue like that! You scared me!",

    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_000": "Actually, Kii-boy, I had somethin' I wanted to talk to ya about. See, I've got\r\nthis medicine and I was hopin' you could try it and see what it does.",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_001": "Uh, where do I even start...?\r\nOkay, first, just tell me what this stuff is in the first place.",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_002": "It's all purple and bubbly...\r\nHonestly, it doesn't look very safe to drink.",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_003": "*sigh*... You've been paranoid like this since the SAO days, huh, Kii-boy?\r\nDid ya forget we're friends?",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_004": "Ya know I wouldn't make ya take anythin' too weird, right?",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_005": "Y-You sure about that...?",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_006": "Anyway, this thing here's a love potion.\r\nOr to be more \"scientific,\" an aphrodisiac.",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_007": "Seriously?! I knew there was something weird about this stuff!",
    "mv_FB_S_ARGO_000_008": "Nyahaha, calm down, calm down. I know this is a VRMMO 'n' all,\r\nbut they wouldn't put out any medicine that's THAT dangerous, would they?",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_000": "I feel like it's been a long time since I've seen your face like this, Kirito.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_001": "Oh yeah? I was under the impression you see it every day.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_002": "Oh, c'mon, you know that's not what I meant.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_003": "Ha ha, I know. I was just joking.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_004": "But yeah, I guess we haven't had a chance to talk like this since the whole\r\nDeath Gun incident, huh?",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_005": "Yeah, about that...",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_006": "I want you to stop being so reckless. I watched your match...\r\nI was so afraid something was going to happen to you...",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_007": "Sorry about that...",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_008": "I kept thinking you might die...",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_009": "Even now that the whole thing has blown over...\r\nI keep getting the feeling that you're going to go somewhere far, far away...",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_010": "I don't plan on leaving you, Asuna.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_011": "Really...?",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_012": "Really.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_013": "...No matter what happens, I'll always be by your side, Kirito.\r\nThat's a promise.",
    "mv_FB_S_ASUNA_000_014": "Of course... And I promise I'll always be there for you.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_000": "Mind if I join you?",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_001": "Things got... complicated with those guys.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_002": "I just didn't feel comfortable sleeping around them. Hence why I came to you.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_003": "I'll take your silence to mean tacit approval, then?",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_004": "Right then, pardon me.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_005": "...",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_006": "You're the silent type, huh? I thought for sure you'd ask what happened.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_007": "Well, suit yourself. That makes life easier for me, anyway.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_008": "They've been asking a lot of questions lately.\r\nHeck, it feels more like interrogation.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_009": "And when that comes from someone I don't know very well, it puts me on edge.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_010": "You're not like that, though, which should help me get a good night's rest.",
    "mv_FB_S_EIJI_000_011": "Sorry for talking so much when we're both trying to sleep. Good night.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_000": "Anyway, how are you coming to terms with this new world?\r\nI'm sure it's way different from where you just were.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_001": "Yeah, I can't say I've gotten too used to it yet.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_002": "For one thing, guns... That's what you call those weapons, isn't it?\r\nThey seem really strong, but they're unlike any weapon I've ever seen before.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_003": "That's fair. They're not exactly something you'd come across ordinarily\r\nin your day-to-day life.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_004": "Right... It's more than just the guns, though.\r\nI feel like I haven't really warmed up to this world itself yet.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_005": "It's all deserts and ruins everywhere, so it's hard to find a place\r\nwhere I can just relax. Obviously it's different when I'm with you, though.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_006": "Oh, I get it.\r\nWell, if it'll help, let's try to stay close and fight together from now on.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_007": "We're lucky to be surrounded by so many amazing gunners,\r\nso I'm sure you'll get really good yourself in no time.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_008": "Yeah, I'd like that.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_009": "Anyway, we should get some shuteye. We've got another early day ahead of us.",
    "mv_FB_S_EUGEO_000_010": "Yeah, definitely. Good night, Kirito.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_000": "Hmm? What's with that look?",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_001": "Ha ha, are you really that surprised to see me lying in your bed?",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_002": "But we're so close now, I thought you wouldn't mind at all...\r\nI'm honestly a little shocked you're taking this so poorly.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_003": "Just messing with you, ha ha. You know me. I just wanted to see your reaction,\r\nand you definitely didn't disappoint.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_004": "Eh, there's no serious reason for me being here. I was just feeling a little\r\ntired and wanted to chat with you while I rested. That's all.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_005": "But what to talk about? That's the question, isn't it?\r\nWell... seeing as we're in bed together and all, how about dreams?",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_006": "I have all sorts myself. Funny dreams, scary dreams, baffling dreams.\r\nYou name it, I have them. I think I might be a light sleeper...",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_007": "But it's not like I'm actually taking part in them. Whenever I dream,\r\nit's more like I'm spectating what's happening from the sidelines.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_008": "What about you...?\r\nOh yeah? In your dreams, you're always an active participant, huh?",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_009": "That sounds fun. I wish I had dreams like that.\r\nIt must feel really immersive compared to what I'm used to.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_010": "Heh heh, talking to you like this, though,\r\nI get the feeling I just might have one of those dreams myself.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_011": "But for now, I think it's time I called it a day.\r\nHeh heh, you don't mind me sleeping here, right? Seeing as we're friends.",
    "mv_FB_S_ITSUKI_000_012": "Thanks... Night.",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_000": "Y-You know, it's kind of awkward sleeping next to you like this...\r\nThere's not a whole lot of room here either.",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_001": "...What? What are you looking at me like that for?",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_002": "I mean, I realize this is your bed, but I fell asleep in it first!\r\nWhoever falls asleep first wins! That's how it works, right?",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_003": "...Yeah, you're right. I really shouldn't worry about it so much.\r\nThis is just a virtual world, after all.",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_004": "Besides, when we were little, I remember we used to nap together\r\nduring the day too...",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_005": "Hehe, I'd kind of forgotten about all that.\r\nOh, that brings back a lot of memories...",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_006": "You always slept in such weird positions, so you'd kick me in your sleep.\r\nHmm? You're saying it was me who kicked you?",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_007": "Th-That can't be right! I'd never kick you in my sleep...! Huh?!\r\nYou even have a PHOTO of me doing that on display at your house?!",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_008": "Urgh... I don't believe you! Forget this! No more sleeping next to you!",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_009": "Get out! Now! Out! Out! Out!",
    "mv_FB_S_KUREHA_000_010": "Hmm? I'm literally kicking you out right now?\r\nOh, ahaha, ha...",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_000": "Feels like forever since we've slept like this, huh?",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_001": "Yeah, it does. I mean, we used to sleep like this all the time\r\nwhen we were little. But yeah, it's been a while.",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_002": "Doesn't it feel a little weird doing it looking like this?\r\nIt's like we're two completely different people or something...",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_003": "In terms of looks, yeah. But I can tell it's you.",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_004": "An avatar is just an avatar. The player behind it is still the same person.\r\nYou're still my little sister, Sugu.",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_005": "...",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_006": "Hehehe.",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_007": "Wh-What? Why are you looking at me like that? Did I say something funny?",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_008": "Oh, nothing. I was just thinking that no matter what you do,\r\nyou'll always be my big brother.",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_009": "I've worried about us not being real siblings before, though...\r\nMe being your cousin and all...",
    "mv_FB_S_LEAFA_000_010": "But you'll always be a big brother to me!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_000": "I've actually been doing a bit of research into sleeping in the virtual world.",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_001": "You can adjust some settings to make your bedroom in the virtual world\r\nsoundproof, right?",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_002": "Because of that, it's supposedly better to sleep here in the virtual world\r\nthan it is in The Real World.",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_003": "But it's not just noise reduction. To improve the quality of your sleep,\r\nyou need good bedding. The right bed, pillows, and sheets, of course!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_004": "R-Right...",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_005": "Did you know? Stuff like beds, pillows, and sheets are treated as items,\r\nso that means they can be crafted!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_006": "I used to travel around as an artisan in SAO and ALO, after all.",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_007": "That's why I'm interested in learning more about ways to craft items\r\nand help improve people's sleep!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_008": "Ah, okay. I think I finally understand what you're talking about now.",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_009": "Heh heh. You're interested too, right? I can tell by the look on your face.",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_010": "I can help improve the quality of your sleep here, you know!\r\nLet me customize a bed and some pillows for you!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_011": "So you want to use me as a guinea pig for this little experiment of yours?",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_012": "H-Hey! It's not like that at all! Don't say that!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_013": "I'd be doing this for the sole purpose of helping you sleep...\r\nI'd be doing it for you!",
    "mv_FB_S_LISBETH_000_014": "Huh. I see...",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_000": "Phew! I'm beat.",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_001": "Huh? You're saying it's not possible to get tired in the virtual world?",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_002": "I mean, yeah, I'm not tired in a physical sense,\r\nbut I've been using my head a bunch, so I feel tired in some way, you know?",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_003": "I guess the fact that you don't feel tired must mean you're not trying\r\nhard enough, huh?",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_004": "Heh heh. Just kidding. I know better than anybody how much effort\r\nyou put into things. I can see it with my own two eyes.",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_005": "You were awesome today. You came up with a really great way to handle things.\r\nIt kind of took me by surprise.",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_006": "I'm talking about how we got the treasure chest that was in that cavern ravine.\r\nThat isn't how you normally do things, right?",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_007": "Huh... So you came up with that plan with Rei?\r\nI'm gonna have to write down what you guys did, you know, for reference.",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_008": "Ah! Just thinking about that little treasure hunt of ours today makes me wanna\r\ngo out and do it again!",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_009": "Heh heh. I guess it's gotten me really excited as a treasure hunter, you know?",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_010": "Oh, look at the time!\r\nWe're not gonna be able to get any sleep if we keep this up!",
    "mv_FB_S_PHILIA_000_011": "Right, then! I'm off to get some quality rest.",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_000": "G-Good evening.",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_001": "I'm feeling a little sleepy... Would it be okay if I slept here?",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_002": "Thank you...",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_003": "I experienced so many new and interesting things today.",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_004": "Huh? Sleep is required to organize one's daily memories and experiences?",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_005": "I see. So it's not just to rejuvenate the mind and body...",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_006": "If that's the case, then I'd better take great care when I sleep, huh?",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_007": "Huh? Why are you laughing?",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_008": "It sounds weird to say \"take great care\" when talking about sleep?",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_009": "O-Oh, okay. I guess it is a little strange now that I think about it.",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_010": "Thank you for telling me. I've once again learned something new.",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_011": "And in order to properly process this, I'd better get some sleep.",
    "mv_FB_S_PREMIERE_000_012": "Well then, good night.",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_000": "Ehehe, knock, knock!\r\nHuh, I guess I'm still out of my element in quite a few ways here in GGO.",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_001": "You know, up until this point, I've really only played VRMMO games\r\nthat focus on close combat, so I'm still not used to gunfights...",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_002": "But that's exactly why getting the right amount of sleep is crucial, isn't it?\r\nYou need your rest to be ready for the next day.",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_003": "Which means I'd better get to bed. Good night...",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_004": "What's that? You're having trouble getting to sleep? Hmm, I see...",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_005": "Actually, that happens pretty often to me too. Ha ha... I'm a beginner,\r\nso I worry about a lot of things, and I guess that keeps me up sometimes.",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_006": "And when that happens, I like to sing.\r\nKind of like my own little lullaby, I guess...",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_007": "It's a song my mother used to sing to me when I was little. The last time\r\nI sang it to my little sister Seven, she said she vaguely remembered it.",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_008": "Huh? You want to hear it?",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_009": "Hahaha...\r\nUm, I'm not sure I feel too comfortable singing in a place like this...",
    "mv_FB_S_RAIN_000_010": "But the singer in me knows that I can't turn down a request.\r\nAll right, I'll sing it for you. Promise you won't laugh, okay?",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_000": "Thank you so much, Kirito.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_001": "F-For what?",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_002": "I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. That's a debt I can never repay.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_003": "That's not true. I just did what was right.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_004": "That's sweet of you to say.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_005": "But lying here next to you is like a dream come true.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_006": "I mean, this is real, right? I am lying next to you?",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_007": "May... may I hold your hand?",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_008": "Sure.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_009": "I can feel the warmth from it. It feels real.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_010": "Same here.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_011": "Doesn't this remind you of our time with the Moonlit Black Cats?",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_012": "You were by my side back then too, helping me build confidence.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_013": "Minus the hand-holding, though.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_014": "Right.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_015": "You made me feel safe. As if you were giving me a big hug.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_016": "I can feel my face turning bright red. We should probably get to sleep soon.",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_017": "Think you'll be able to sleep?",
    "mv_FB_S_SACHI_000_018": "Mm-hm, as long as you're right here next to me.",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_000": "What? Were you gonna ask me why I'm here?",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_001": "One look at your face was all I needed. You're an open book!\r\nOkay, I'll tell you.",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_002": "I'm here to do some research... on you.",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_003": "I've never seen anyone like you before. You're not like Kirito or the others.",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_004": "And you've gotta really follow people to know what they're like.\r\nWatch them eat and sleep and so on.",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_005": "Not to mention, you seem pretty knowledgeable about GGO,\r\nso I want to talk to you... seeing as this world isn't like the others.",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_006": "I trust that won't be a problem for you?",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_007": "Good. I'll get started right away!",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_008": "Or maybe tomorrow... I just got... really... sleepy...",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_009": "...",
    "mv_FB_S_SEVEN_000_010": "Zzzzzz...",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_000": "Hey, you're okay. Everything's fine now...\r\nThat must've been one scary dream you had.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_001": "Mmhm... there was this scary guy chasing me around.\r\nNo matter how far or how fast I ran, he'd always catch up.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_002": "I tried yelling for help, but nobody came.\r\nHe finally caught up with me and was just about to attack when I woke up...",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_003": "Wow, that sounds horrible, Silica. I can see why you were so shaken up.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_004": "Yeah. It helps that I have Pina looking out for me,\r\nbut now I'm afraid to go back to sleep...",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_005": "And that's why, I uh... kind of burst into your room like that.\r\nI'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_006": "That's okay. You can stay as long as you like.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_007": "Thanks. *sigh*... But you know something?\r\nI wonder why we have bad dreams in the first place...",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_008": "I've heard that usually something like stress is the cause...",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_009": "Hmm... Maybe.\r\nBut I don't really feel like I'm stressed out over anything right now.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_010": "The cause could just vary from person to person.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_011": "Yeah, that might be it...\r\nWhatever it is, it's nice being able to talk to you about this.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_012": "I just feel... safe when I'm next to you.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_013": "Really? Well, I'm glad I could help.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_014": "*yawn* ...And now I'm starting to feel... tired... again...\r\nDo you mind if I... stay here a little... longer...?",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_015": "Not at all. Sleep tight, Silica.",
    "mv_FB_S_SILICA_000_016": "Hrm...",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_000": "Phew... today was pretty rough. Would it be okay if I crashed next to you?",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_001": "S-Sure, I don't mind. You must be pretty tired.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_002": "Hehe. Thanks. You must be tired yourself.\r\nAs usual, you really honed your skills out there.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_003": "Nah, I barely did anything.\r\nIf it weren't for your long-range shots, we would have lost.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_004": "Well, I mean, I was just doing what I normally do, so...",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_005": "I originally used bows and arrows back in ALO, remember?\r\nI've always been better at attacking from a distance, I guess.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_006": "But long-range attacks in a fantasy world are different from those\r\nin a shooting game, right?",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_007": "Heh, yeah. But I wonder why that is...",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_008": "Even though I'm actually covering more distance here, my shots feel just right.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_009": "Maybe it has to do with the fact that the Cait Sith have better eyesight\r\nthan other races in ALO. It's like you know, a special ability?",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_010": "That's probably why I didn't have a real sense of distance in ALO.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_011": "But if that's the case, then your target should feel like it's farther away\r\nand harder to hit in GGO, huh?",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_012": "Yeah, I can't figure it out. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I'm looking\r\nthrough a scope, which makes it feel, I don't know, more real?",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_013": "Heh, maybe that means I'm better suited for GGO.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_014": "Hmm, I guess that's one way to put it...",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_015": "Phew, just thinking about focusing on a target is hurting my eyes.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_016": "I'd better give them a rest... I'm off to bed.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_017": "Gotcha. I'll wake you up when it's time.",
    "mv_FB_S_SINON_000_018": "Thanks... that'd really help me out...",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_000": "Wow! Up close, you have such a cute face! Did you know that?",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_001": "Hee hee, aww, you don't need to be so bashful!",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_002": "Hmm? Now you've got a really serious look on your face. What's wrong?",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_003": "...Oh, you're trying to figure out how you'll beat that quest tomorrow?",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_004": "Aaaah, gotcha. Yeah, that quest definitely looks pretty tough,\r\nso I don't blame you for wanting to go into it prepared.",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_005": "Hee hee, don't forget, I can help with that kind of stuff. Making those sorts\r\nof calculations and coming up with ways to lead effectively are my forte!",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_006": "After all, I'm an NPC built to show what advanced AI has to offer!",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_007": "Hm? You always forget I'm an NPC since I act so human?",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_008": "Hee hee, I'll take that as a compliment! Honestly, I could talk with you\r\nlike this forever. Time always flies when I chat with you.",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_009": "We'll be up all night if we're not careful. We should probably get to sleep.",
    "mv_FB_S_STREA_000_010": "Hee hee, nighty night!",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_000": "Good evening! May I sleep with you tonight?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_001": "Haha, what's that funny face for? Why are you so surprised?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_002": "I just want to keep talking. You seem interesting.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_003": "I'd like to get to know you better, if that's all right.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_004": "So that's a yes, right? To sleeping together?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_005": "Hehe, thank you.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_006": "I want to thank you for agreeing to play with me, first of all.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_007": "Playing with your crew has really shown me a lot. I'm having a blast.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_008": "GGO is a real thrill ride! It's unlike anything in Ordinal Scale.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_009": "There have been a lot of firsts for me,\r\nfrom the sights and sounds to the smells... which sounds really weird to say!",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_010": "But you know a lot about this place, don't you?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_011": "I'm sure that's going to drive the fun factor through the roof!\r\nMaybe I'll just stick with you from here on out...",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_012": "And I won't take no for an answer, hehe! Don't worry, I'll keep up with you.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUNA_000_013": "Well, now that that's settled, it's time to get some sleep. Good night!",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_000": "*yaawn*... Hmm?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_001": "Oh, you're awake, Yuuki?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_002": "Ah ha, now I know where I am.\r\nI must've fallen asleep while we were talking here in your room.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_003": "Heh, sorry about hogging your bed like that. I always sleep like a log.\r\nI can pretty much fall asleep just about anywhere!",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_004": "Haha, I've noticed.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_005": "I really love a good night's sleep.\r\nThe better rested I am, the more I can run around and go nuts here in GGO!",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_006": "But... unlike ALO, isn't it oftentimes pretty dangerous to go running around\r\nin GGO?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_007": "Yeah. You never know when someone might be behind cover,\r\nwatching your every move to figure out when to strike.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_008": "Ahaha, for sure.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_009": "You know me, though.\r\nMy first instinct is to run right after an enemy and fight them head-on.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_010": "But you can't really do that if you want to get anywhere in GGO.\r\nIt's challenging, but that's what makes it fun.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_011": "Definitely. This game really expects you to think tactically in order to win.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_012": "I'm always amazed how you can still think clearly when you're in the middle\r\nof an intense fight.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_013": "Whereas in my case, Asuna's always reminding me to watch for enemies\r\nfrom behind and stuff.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_014": "Like today, I ran right into enemy territory, and without even checking to see\r\nif anyone was targeting me, I did this really flashy, time-consuming move.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_015": "Haha, and it's like, I know if I acted that recklessly on a real battlefield,\r\nI'd draw too much attention to myself and wouldn't last a minute.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_016": "Yet somehow, I always make it out of the hornet's nest in one piece.\r\nI guess that's why they call me a VRMMO living legend, right?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_017": "Someone's feeling humble today, I see.",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_018": "Anywho, I should probably get back to sleep so I can stay sharp\r\nfor whatever craziness lies in store for me tomorrow!",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_019": "Really? You're going to sleep again just like that?",
    "mv_FB_S_YUUKI_000_020": "Hehe, I told you! I love my sleep! I'll take as much as I can get!",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_000": "Oh right, this is your room, huh? Hehe, sorry for intruding like this.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_001": "Your bed is just so comfy. I ended up drifting off without even meaning to.\r\nWhy don't you join me? I'd love to have you...",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_002": "Hehe, aww, are you blushing? Sweetie, don't read into what I say too much now.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_003": "Oh, by the way, do you usually sleep in The Real World\r\nor do you often fall asleep in VR like this?",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_004": "Hehe, I'm just curious. No special reason why I want to know...",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_005": "From what I gather, there are an awful lot of people who fall asleep in VR\r\nthese days.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_006": "All of your senses remain intact when you're in VR and there's not much\r\nthat can wake you in the middle of the night, so a lot of people find it easier\r\nto sleep online these days.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_007": "It makes sense. You get your own room here, and you don't have to worry\r\nabout other people snoring or anybody making noise outside.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_008": "Some people still prefer sleeping next to somebody,\r\nbut it's not like that can't be arranged in VR.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_009": "Hmm? Which way do I prefer to sleep?",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_010": "I sleep a decent amount here, but I figure I probably still sleep more\r\nin The Real World.",
    "mv_FB_S_ZELISKA_000_011": "I just have a lot on my plate in real life...",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_000": "Special Sword Skill—\"Star Splash\"!",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_001": "Wha—?!",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_002": "Ha ha ha, I did it! Critical Hit!",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_003": "That's basically just a water gun!",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_004": "If not even the Black Swordsman could dodge it,\r\nit's not \"just\" a water gun, now is it?",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_005": "You've really done it now, Asuna...",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_006": "Hee hee... Come at me. Asuna the Lighting Flash's—",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_007": "Gotcha!",

    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_100_009": "I don't take defeat lying down! Heh heh.",

    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_110_001": "Sorry, Mommy...",

    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_110_008": "D-D-Don't jump on me so suddenly! I wasn't mentally prepared!",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_110_009": "Was it bad?",
    "mv_HF_E_ASUNA_110_010": "N-No, but... Grr. Kirito... this part of you, I—",

    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_001": "Of course I do.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_002": "Back then, I felt like you forgave me, but—",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_003": "That means I conveyed my feelings to you as well, right?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_004": "W-Well... Yeah, I guess you have.",

    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_006": "H-Hey, Philia, you're getting a little too close!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_007": "You understand, right? My feelings...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_008": "I-I, well... Yes! Friendship and affection and those sorts of feelings.\r\nYes, definitely those sorts of feelings...",

    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_012": "(She finally backed off.)",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_013": "There isn't some handy item that could tell us exactly how we feel, is there?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_014": "No, there isn't.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_015": "(What a terrifying world it would be if there was!)",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_016": "We can't see each other's statuses, either...\r\nWe just have to do our honest best.",

    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_018": "Why my full name all of a sudden?!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_019": "Thank you, really.\r\nThe only reason I am here right now is because you helped me.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_020": "And you're the reason I can feel as deeply as I do...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_021": "That's a bit much. We're not strangers. We're friends, right?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_022": "Friends...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_023": "This isn't the kind of relationship that ended with SAO.\r\nWe'll always be friends.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_024": "Kazuto... Is it all right to think that we're close?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_025": "That's what I'm telling you!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_026": "Well...",

    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_028": "Wh-Whoa, what are you doing all of a sudden...!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_029": "Heh heh... That little thank-you just now? That's how I feel.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_030": "You startled me. Kotone, that sort of thing is...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_031": "That's as far as I'll go—Well, this time at least.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_032": "This time? Will there be a next time?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_033": "Hee hee hee. Well, you said we're close, didn't you?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_034": "We are, but... Just take it slow, please.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_030_035": "Okay!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_000": "Well, Philia, it's about time to go back to Aincrad.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_001": "Yeah... It feels kind of strange, though...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_002": "Like going back to a house you've moved out of...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_003": "I'm sure you'll get used to it in no time. It is home, after all.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_004": "Well, home in SAO, that is.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_005": "Right... You know, I haven't thought about The Real World for a long while...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_006": "I was in such a pit of despair... until you lifted me out of it, Kirito.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_007": "Oh come on I didn't do anything. You're the one who saved yourself, Philia.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_008": "And now we've got all these powerful skills and items from the Hollow Area.\r\nIt shouldn't be long before we clear this game.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_009": "Then we can go back to our real homes...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_010": "In the meantime, though, I guess we should focus on getting settled in Aincrad.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_011": "Okay!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_012": "Now, we'd better go over there so I can introduce you to everyone.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_013": "These are the same people you introduced me to\r\nwhen you first came to the Hollow Area?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_014": "Yeah. But I've also got other friends you haven't met yet.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_015": "They can be quite peculiar, but everyone's really nice.\r\nI think you'll be good friends in no time.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_016": "I mean, if that's what you want to do, of course...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_017": "Yes, I want to get to know your friends, Kirito.\r\nI know you're a good judge of character.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_018": "Besides, I just want to be close to you...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_019": "Eh? What did you just say?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_100_020": "Oh... Nothing.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_000": "What do you want with me? Why are you hassling me like this?\r\nI don't know anything about Hollows or anything like that.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_001": "Ha... That exactly why I do it.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_002": "You and your prince live in different worlds.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_003": "I mean that very literally, by the way.",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_004": "You belong in the world of shadows... Yes... The Hollow Area...\r\nThat's your home. You see, you and me, we're not really people...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_005": "I-I'm...?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_006": "Have you ever thought about why you can't go with him when he goes back?",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_007": "Stop it! I'm nothing like you! I AM human!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_008": "Why can't you just accept it? Admit that you're not a person!",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_009": "You're no different from me... We're just the same...",
    "mv_HF_E_PHILIA_110_010": "Wow! Now that look of pure despair on your face,\r\nit's exactly what I wanted to see! You're making me drool...",

    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_000": "I... The real me also finally took her first step, didn't she?",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_001": "All thanks to you, Kirito.",

    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_003": "No, Sachi...\r\nI haven't done anything to earn your thanks.",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_004": "Heh heh, I've finally told you everything.\r\nEverything the real me left in this empty shell. I'm so glad I found you, Kirito.",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_005": "Thank you, Sachi...",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_006": "All I wanted to do was tell you how I felt...",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_007": "So, Kirito, all you have to do to make me happy is keep moving forward.\r\nDon't worry about anything.",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_008": "But...\r\nThen I can't be with—",
    "mv_HF_E_SACHI_010_009": "What you're going to say next is very sweet of you, but don't say it.\r\nI'm okay, Kirito.",

    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_010": "W-Well, in any case, good thing it was just a dream.",
    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_011": "Indeed. And... please do be careful, even outside of my dreams.",
    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_012": "You're always acting so rashly. It's hard to feel at ease around you.",
    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_013": "Yeah, okay. I'll be careful, Alice.",
    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_014": "So... now that's settled, do you think you could let go of me?",

    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_018": "Agh... A-Anyway, get away from me!",
    "mv_HR_S_ALICE_000_019": "Okay, okay! I will! Just calm down, Alice!",

    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_003": "Besides... I don't get to see ya as much anymore.\r\nNot compared to how often we crossed paths in Sword Art Online.",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_004": "Well, things have changed since then, right? I mean, we can log out.\r\nWe're not trapped in a game of constant fear and death. So that's good.",

    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_006": "What do you mean? Is there some other reason we don't see each other?",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_007": "Betcha life there is.\r\nAnd it's starin' ya right in that pretty little face o'yours.",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_008": "A reason that we don't see each other... Really, only logging out comes to mind.",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_009": "Take your hand, put it to your heart and search those feelings. Better yet, \r\nthink back. Your memories. What's all around ya?",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_010": "Around me?",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_011": "This ain't a brain teaser, kiddo. Exactly. All around ya.",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_012": "The maps we play in? The people we party with?",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_013": "You're getting there...",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_014": "Every time I see ya, more girls are circling,\r\nbegging for some of that Kiri love. There ain't time for little ol' me.",

    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_016": "Good thing you're cute, because you can be real dumb.\r\n'Sides I got my info business, I can't be around as much as the others.",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_017": "Okay, okay. I hear you loud and clear. I'll make more time just for us. Promise.",
    "mv_HR_S_ARGO_000_018": "Nyahaha! Mission accomplished! I'll be holdin' you to that.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_000": "Don't you think being together like this reminds us of that time back in SAO?",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_001": "You mean the first night we spent together?",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_002": "Yeah... I was so nervous I was practically shaking. I'll never forget it though.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_003": "So much has happened since then...",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_004": "So much. But still... these feelings between us haven't changed.\r\nThese moments will always be enough.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_005": "Heh... And I'm still just as tense as that first night.\r\nPractically ready to snap.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_006": "Haha... I know, Asuna.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_007": "*sigh* Did you have to laugh at me?! You jerk...! Mood-killer!",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_008": "Sorry, sorry, I couldn't help it!\r\nIt was kinda cute, the way you smile when you reach out.",

    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_010": "I am? Hehe... Guess I am pretty nervous too.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_011": "Do you think we'll ever get past this nervousness...\r\nWe've been together for so long already.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_012": "I... I don't know. But this feeling, it's not bad, is it?\r\nIt's... kind of exhilarating.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_013": "I know that we'll never be bored when we're together.\r\nAll time with you is well spent, my Asuna.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_014": "Even here, do you promise to spend time with me?\r\nJust the two of us.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_015": "I promise. We will always make memories together. Beautiful, perfect memories.",
    "mv_HR_S_ASUNA_000_016": "I... I love you, Kirito. More than anyone or anything.\r\nIn this world or any other. For all time.",

    "mv_HR_S_EUGEO_000_001": "Eugeo's sound asleep.",
    "mv_HR_S_EUGEO_000_002": "(I don't know... Seeing him like this makes me want to play a prank on him...)",
    "mv_HR_S_EUGEO_000_003": "Hah!",
    "mv_HR_S_EUGEO_000_004": "Wow, his cheeks are really squishy. I'll try poking them again.",

    "mv_HR_S_EUGEO_000_011": "No, I didn't do a thing.",
    "mv_HR_S_EUGEO_000_012": "Hmm... Maybe I imagined it. Still, my cheeks feel odd..",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_000": "You... You dream of me?",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_001": "(I seem to recall Kizmel saying she had dreams of me back in Sword Art Online,\r\ntoo.)",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_002": "(Wait... Does this mean they're the same kind of dream?)",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_003": "Is it really so surprising that I would dream of you?",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_004": "No, I think I was just a bit surprised. \r\nTell me, wh-what kind of dreams are they?",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_005": "Dreams where you appear before me. You look towards me, for a moment\r\nthat seems to pass slower than time.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_006": "There is something different about you in my dreams, however.\r\nYou seem... sadder. Like there was a solemn look on your face.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_007": "To speak in truth, this has been bothering me for some time.\r\nI fear there are some heavy thoughts on your mind.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_008": "It's kind of you to worry, Kizmel, but I assure you that I'm well.\r\nLook, entirely happy and healthy.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_009": "Of course... If you insist that all is well, I will also stop worrying so deeply \r\nabout you from now on.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_010": "Still... if there is anything that worries you, anything at all,\r\nI do hope that you will come to me. I will always help.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_011": "Thank you, Kizmel. You are undeniably kind.",
    "mv_HR_S_KIZMEL_000_012": "I am only doing that which you have done for me.",

    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_000": "...",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_001": "So... can I ask why you're staring at me like that?",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_002": "Hm... I knew it! We don't look anything like each other, do we?",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_003": "Hehe! Of course not, this is in Full Dive.\r\nYou're using an avatar... your ALO avatar, at that.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_004": "I wasn't talking about the game, I meant... y'know, in real life.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_005": "It's been on my mind lately. We don't really look related.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_006": "Well, what about all those people who thought we looked like twins when we\r\nwere little?",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_007": "Ha! I totally forgot. Everyone thought we were sisters.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_008": "You totally looked like a little girl, Kirito.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_009": "I... did?",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_010": "Heh... Hmm...",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_011": "Wh-What?",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_012": "Hehehe! Nothing, nothing... I mean, you still kinda do.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_013": "*scoff* Well, sorry I'm not all buff and macho!",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_014": "No, that's not what I meant. I wasn't trying to be mean.\r\nI think you look kinda cool... You always have.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_015": "But more than anything, you look like my older brother. That's what matters.",
    "mv_HR_S_LEAFA_000_016": "So, come here, big bro! Lemme take a real close look at you.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_000": "But all that unease, that hesitation... It disappears when I'm with you.\r\nLike looking at you melts it all away.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_001": "With me? Heh... Why's that?",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_002": "I have absolutely no idea. Hehe! I guess it has something to do with how\r\nyou act. You're never stressed or worried. Ever.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_003": "Huh... I don't really know what you mean by that.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_004": "Of course. That answer is 100% unadulterated you. And that's perfect.\r\nYou have only one task now. Get some sleep.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_005": "That, I can do. ",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_006": "...",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_007": "I-It's a little unsettling to have you staring silently at me, you know?",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_008": "Oh, don't be a baby...! I'm just looking at you. That's all.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_009": "I know, but... still..",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_010": "...",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_011": "Liz?",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_012": "*sigh* Can't you sit still for like five seconds? Hehe.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_013": "I... I can. Just, are you sure looking at me calms you down?\r\nYour cheeks are bright red right now.",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_014": "Sh-Shut up and go to sleep! I'm perfectly calm! You don't have to worry\r\nabout me! I'm calmer than I have ever been!",
    "mv_HR_S_LISBETH_000_015": "So, just shhh. And let me watch you. Just for a little bit.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_000": "Okay then, let me return the favor.\r\nI'll show you something only a treasure hunter could.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_001": "What is it? You sense some treasure?",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_002": "Mmhm! Actually, there's something priceless and rare in this room right now.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_003": "In my room? I have some cool swords, but I don't think I've got anything\r\nto that extent.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_004": "Hehe! Of course you do, silly. Right here.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_005": "Ph-Philia? My hand..?",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_006": "Isn't it obvious? You. You are my greatest treasure.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_007": "M-Me? ...I don't think you'd get much for me on the market, though.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_008": "No... I would never sell this treasure. It has made such an impact on my life.\r\nIt gave me hope. It made my future bright and clear.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_009": "This is one treasure I never, ever plan on letting go.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_010": "I am honored that you value me so deeply, Philia.\r\nI don't know that I'm worth all that, but I will try to live up to it.",
    "mv_HR_S_PHILIA_000_011": "I wouldn't worry if I were you. Hehe!",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_000": "Show me your hands.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_001": "Sure... Why, though?",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_002": "It is from here that you wield your blade.\r\nThe secret may be locked within, and I am seeking it.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_003": "It's a nice sentiment, but I don't think you'll find much.\r\nThere's nothing special about my hands.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_004": "Hm... It appears you are correct.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_004_1": "However, I have made a unique discovery.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_005": "Wh-What?",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_006": "Your hands... are warm. Very warm.\r\nCould this be the secret of your strength?",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_007": "I don't know if strength is about one ingredient.\r\nIt's more like a mixture of spices...! That worked better in my head.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_008": "Then if you can spare that warmth, would you share it with me? Hold my hand\r\ntightly... Please.",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_009": "Anything you ask. How's this?",
    "mv_HR_S_PREMIERE_000_010": "Hehe... I feel stronger already. Your warmth is spreading through me.",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_000": "It's just... I might be a little nervous about holding your hand like this...",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_001": "Nervous? I would have thought that a pop star would have plenty of chances\r\nto shake hands with fans.",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_002": "Yes, yes of course I do, but this is totally different!",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_003": "Huh?\r\nBut I feel like holding a hand and shaking one are practically the same thing... ",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_003_1": "Ugh, no it's not.",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_004": "Your hand is special!",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_005": "I don't think there is a specific setting for unique hand models though...",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_006": "That's not what I mean! I mean... that... I like this hand...",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_007": "So can we stay like this for a bit?",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_008": "Hm? Sure, I don't particularly mind.",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_009": "Heh heh. Thank you!",
    "mv_HR_S_RAIN_000_010": "(I don't really get it, but she seems to be happy, so whatever.)",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_000": "(...Oops, I fell asleep too.)",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_001": "(My arm feels really heavy, like there's something weighing on it...)",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_002": "*munch*",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_003": "Owowow! Seven! Don't bite my arm like that!",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_004": "Nomnomnom... Delishush... Thish shauce ish amashing...",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_005": "(Could she be eating in her dream...?)",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_006": "And these potatosh...",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_007": "Ouch! Stop chewing on me!",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_008": "Orange juish... Orange juish!",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_009": "Eww, now she's slurping!",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_010": "H-Huh? Hamburger?",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_011": "F-Finally she's waking up...",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_012": "Seven... I have one favor to ask of you, and only one.",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_013": "Hm?",
    "mv_HR_S_SEVEN_000_014": "Forget perseverance. Just eat something... anything!\r\nYou being hungry is just too dangerous.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_000": "What did you think...? O-Of me. Wh-when we first met, I mean.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_001": "Hmm... my first impression... I think I knew right off the bat how much you cared\r\nabout Pina.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_002": "Heh... Totally true. Not exactly what I was hoping, but still entirely true.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_003": "If you didn't care tremendously about her,\r\nyou never would have gone item hunting with a total stranger like me.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_004": "Th-That's not true at all!",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_005": "Well, kinda true. Anyway, even the first time I saw you, I got this sense\r\nthat I could trust you. Hehe... weird, huh?",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_006": "I never knew you thought of me that way... It's very sweet, Silica. I'm honored.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_007": "Of course. I know what kind of person you are.\r\nSo wonderful, kind, and strong. So caring.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_008": "And I got to know how incredible you are, Silica.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_009": "Hehe... Th-Thank you.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_010": "We know so much more about each other now, don't we?",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_011": "Of course.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_012": "A-And... I feel like we've gotten closer. Like, a lot closer.\r\nLike our heart beats in unison.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_013": "I think so too.",
    "mv_HR_S_SILICA_000_014": "I want you to know everything there is about me.\r\nAnd I want you to teach me everything there is about you. Promise me.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_000": "I... Okay. Here goes. You're incredible, Sinon.\r\nYou are so smart, sweet and strong.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_001": "H-Hey!",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_002": "Shh, hush hush. You work so hard, and I am so proud.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_003": "Wh-What is wrong with you?!",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_004": "No? That wasn't better? I did it to Leafa once and she was grinning for like\r\nthree days.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_005": "Are you serious?! Patting me on the head and praising me?\r\nWhat am I, a cat?! I am... shocked!",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_006": "Sorry, sorry. I... learned my lesson. Definitely won't do that again.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_007": "Well, let's not be crazy. I forgive you... this time.\r\nI suppose it may have been my fault after all.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_008": "B-Besides, even though it was ridiculous, I think perhaps...Yes, you did finally\r\nget your feelings across. Emphasis on \"finally\".",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_009": "I did? That's a relief.",
    "mv_HR_S_SINON_000_010": "...Mmm, I'm ready to work even harder now. Promise.",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_000": "You wanna be my hug pillow?",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_001": "I-I'm not a pillow!",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_002": "But you're so warm and snuggable and squeezable!\r\nI'll sleep like a baby holding my lovey-dovey hug pillow!",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_003": "And I can't afford to lose you! So I'm never gonna let go!",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_004": "H-Help... World... growing dark...",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_005": "Yay! My personal love pillow! Best day ever!\r\nMmmmm! I will give you lots of snuggles!",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_006": "Hmm... A good girl shares, right? Yeah!\r\nI gotta show all my friends my newest, bestest pillow!\r\n",
    "mv_HR_S_STREA_000_007": "Strea... Strea, why?! Whyyyyyy~!",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_000": "Hehe! You really do love food, don'tcha? Lemme have it!",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_001": "So, I was in the forest when a bird monster swooped down at me!\r\nI took it out, naturally, and it dropped this meat. ",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_002": "Mmhm...",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_003": "The bird was huge though-like, gigantic.\r\nSo the meat it dropped was equally ginormous.",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_004": "...",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_005": "I picked it up and shoved it right into my pack and... Yuuki?\r\nAh, looks like she fell asleep.",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_006": "I guess she wasn't interested in a story about meat.",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_007": "Ahnn...\r\n*chomp*",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_008": "Whaaa! Y-Yuuki...?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_009": "Mmmn... Nnnmm...",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_010": "Ow... Ow... Okay, so she's sleep-biting me. That's fine. Ngh!",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_011": "Mmm...?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_012": "A-Are you awake?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_013": "Mm... Sorry. Did I fall asleep?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_014": "Yeah, but I don't mind. That was the plan, right?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_015": "Oh, th-thanks... Hmm...",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_016": "What's up?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_017": "I'm actually kinda hungry. Like... really, really hungry.\r\nDo you mind if we put off the nap and go snacking instead?",
    "mv_HR_S_YUUKI_000_018": "Hahaha! Sure. I guess my tale of meat got to you after all.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_000": "You make me feel like it's all worth it, you know that?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_001": "I-I do?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_002": "...Mmm.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_003": "Heh heh... Are you blushing?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_004": "Hm? N-No, I... just wasn't expecting that all of a sudden.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_005": "You silly thing. Promise me you'll always be there to cheer me up?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_000_006": "Of course I will.",

    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_020_001": "I-I look silly, don't I?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_020_002": "N-No, not at all... Who'd have thought a simple apron could have such...\r\npower depending on how it was worn?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_020_003": "Well, it's on now. So now what do I do?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_020_004": "I suppose you just do... y'know, normal stuff. Like cooking, that kind of thing.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_020_005": "Cooking... Okay, here goes nothing.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_020_006": "I-It's no good! I can't!",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_030_000": "...Wait. This is a marriage ceremony, right? So if we've sworn our love to one\r\nanother, isn't there something that usually comes after that?",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_030_001": "Y-You're right. Okay, Asuna... Face this way.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_030_002": "...Okay.",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_030_003": "Thou hast sworn thy love to one another before God's watchful gaze.",

    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_050_001": "I think that's a great idea. It could be ten years from now,\r\nor maybe even twenty until it's possible though...",
    "mv_IM_E_ASUNA_050_002": "...But whatever it takes, someday the four of us'll come here again,\r\nand gaze out on this skyline together.",

    "mv_LS_SUB_210_011": "I'm glad you like it, Yui.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_210_012": "Yui, let's be sure to take lots of family photos from now on.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_000": "I can't believe I haven't found them yet...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_001": "Oh no. What if something happened to them...?!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_002": "Yui! Silica!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_003": "*huff* *huff*",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_004": "What am I gonna do? I can't find them anywhere...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_005": "(Hm? What's a wagon doing here? There wasn't one there earlier.)",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_006": "...Yui! Silica!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_007": "Ha ha... So that's where they were hiding.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_008": "That was a good idea, hiding in one of the town wagons.\r\nNo place to hide like a tree in a forest, as they say.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_220_009": "Hey, Yui, Silica. I found you.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_230_000": "I don't suppose we can just enjoy our cake without...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_230_001": "...*snicker*.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_230_002": "Huh?",
    "mv_LS_SUB_230_003": "What? Why did you laugh after you looked at Sev—",
    "mv_LS_SUB_231_000": "Ha ha, never mind.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_231_001": "Huh? What is it? Why are you laughing at me?!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_231_002": "Ha ha, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. It's just...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_231_003": "You were talking so passionately but you had cream on your face\r\nthe entire time.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_232_000": "What? Where?! Why didn't you say so sooner?!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_232_001": "I would have, but it seemed rude to interrupt.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_232_002": "There's nothing rude about telling someone they've got cream on their face!\r\nUgh, I'm so embarrassed...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_232_003": "Haha. You're pretty cute sometimes.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_232_004": "I guess that's one of the advantages of being as young as Seven is.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_232_005": "Hey! Stop being so mean!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_000": "(Yuuki... What are you up to?)",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_001": "...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_002": "Ha!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_003": "There. It's ready...",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_004": "That was...your 11-hit Original Sword Skill...!",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_005": "Yes. And I want you to have it.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_006": "Are you sure...?",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_007": "I am... It's proof of the bond that we share. Make good use of it, okay?",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_008": "Yuuki... Thank you. I promise I'll take good care of it.",
    "mv_LS_SUB_240_009": "Okay... Thank you...",
    "svo0100_001": "Link Start!",
    "svo0101_001": "Whew! Not too bad. Wish I could've grinded a bit more, though.",
    "svo0101_002": "But it's almost time to meet up with her. Guess I'll just call that a wrap.",
    "svo0101_003": "Oh, a message. Wonder who it's from?",
    "svo0101_004": "Hey Bro, you free? Drop by the log cabin if you are. I've something I wanna show you.",
    "svo0101_005": "The others'll be there too. See you!",
    "svo0101_006": "Mmm, well this is awkward. I've already got plans... What's this all about?",
    "svo0101_007": "Still, I am curious what this could be about. What the heck could Sugu be up to?",
    "svo0101_008": "Hope you weren't kept waiting too long, Kirito.",
    "svo0101_009": "Oh, there you are. You're right on time.\r\nWell, I promised you the grand tour of ALfheim Online, so let's get to it!",
    "svo0101_010": "Actually, do you mind if we take a little detour first?",
    "svo0101_011": "I suppose that's fine. Where to?",
    "svo0101_012": "My friends are getting together right now, so I figured this'd be a good opportunity to introduce everyone.",
    "svo0101_013": "Ready to go?",
    "svo0101_013_2": "Quinella?",
    "svo0102_001": "Awesome! We took that boss down splendidly! Great job, guys!",
    "svo0102_002": "You too! So, Quinella got the most kills?",
    "svo0102_003": "I took down a fair few myself, but I guess it wasn't enough. Oh well.",
    "svo0102_004": "This is your first time in ALO, right, Quinella?\r\nI think it's amazing you can pull off all those moves.",
    "svo0102_005": "It wasn't that impressive, really.",
    "svo0102_006": "Don't sell yourself short! You were a total badass, lady!\r\nYou cut those monsters to ribbons like a legendary valkyrie!",
    "svo0102_007": "Or maybe more like a lone flower blooming on the battlefield...?\r\nHey, can I send you a friend request? Pretty please?",
    "svo0102_008": "...",
    "svo0102_009": "Ugh. Stop flirting, would you, Klein? You're weirding her out.",
    "svo0102_010": "I-I wasn't flirting! I just want to help her figure out the game quicker!",
    "svo0102_011": "Even if that's true, don't you think you could ask her like a normal person?",
    "svo0102_012": "Ahaha... I have to admit I'm surprised.\r\nI never knew you went to our school, Quinella.",
    "svo0102_013": "Yeah, this has gotta be fate. We'll show you just how great ALO is.",
    "svo0102_014": "Hehe! I appreciate that. It's certainly nice of you to look out for me.",
    "svo0102_015": "Kirito's just a nice guy at heart, that's all.",
    "svo0102_016": "Yeah, I've also grown a tad interested in him.",
    "svo0102_017": "Huh? Wait, what did you say?",
    "svo0102_018": "Hey, guys! The Gate's about to close.",
    "svo0102_019": "Guess it took us right back to the cabin, huh?",
    "svo0102_020": "Hmm... I'd heard stories, but seeing Galaxia in person is something else.\r\nThat was so real, you'd never guess it was reconstructed footage.",
    "svo0102_021": "I know, right?! Though it has all kinds of limits, of course.\r\nStill, I think we'll get a lot out of it, so I wanna try it out some more.",
    "svo0102_022": "Hey, Leafa?",
    "svo0102_023": "Huh? What's up?",
    "svo0102_024": "I must admit, I'm still not really sure what just happened.\r\nWhat in the world was up with that battle?",
    "svo0102_025": "First that Gate appeared in front of the cabin, then that enemy showed up right as we passed through...",
    "svo0102_026": "At first I thought it was some kind of event, but I didn't get any notification.",
    "svo0102_027": "Wait... You mean you've never heard of Galaxia before?",
    "svo0102_028": "It's this extension added to The Seed VR world systems that's getting super popular.",
    "svo0102_029": "Sorry, I've been so focused on grinding lately that I must've missed it.",
    "svo0102_030": "Oh, but the name sounds familiar, now that I think about it.\r\nMaybe I saw it in an MMO Today article.",
    "svo0102_031": "Though I probably skimmed it since I thought it didn't have much to do with the game.",
    "svo0102_032": "That's classic Kirito for you.",
    "svo0102_033": "Then I'll give you the lowdown.\r\nGalaxia is a new add-on that allows you to replay super high-precision recreations of the past!",
    "svo0102_034": "How does that work?",
    "svo0102_035": "Well, you know how there've been games with album functions?\r\nThe ones that take snapshots of in-game scenes and let you view them like a souvenir?",
    "svo0102_036": "Well, Galaxia turns that into an actual playable experience\r\nby recording entire scenes that you can replay.",
    "svo0102_037": "It recreates not just the visuals, but also the sounds, vibrations, and even the smells in your VR device, so it feels extremely real.",
    "svo0102_038": "And the coolest thing of all is that it allows you to engage with the recreations!",
    "svo0102_039": "Meaning if you go to the past, you can change the course of events thanks to simulations carried out by the latest computers.",
    "svo0102_040": "Like, you can reattempt a quest you failed and try to succeed.",
    "svo0102_041": "You can also bring along people who weren't even there before!",
    "svo0102_042": "Wait, let me get this straight. You're saying that battle was...",
    "svo0102_043": "A monster mob I encountered while grinding the other day.",
    "svo0102_044": "Galaxia recorded my battle data, so I figured I'd recreate it.",
    "svo0102_045": "I was playing solo at the time, so I got beat pretty bad.\r\nIt was so humiliating that I swore revenge on them!",
    "svo0102_046": "And what do you know, they couldn't hold a candle to our party!",
    "svo0102_047": "Man, it's wild how far technology's come.\r\nI seriously felt like I was there.",
    "svo0102_048": "I heard the devs have been providing official content too.\r\nLike recreations of limited time-only events, quests, and battles with special monsters.",
    "svo0102_049": "Yeah, that's right!",
    "svo0102_050": "Wow! That sounds like fun!\r\nYou think you can redo failed events to get them to turn out right?",
    "svo0102_051": "Well... I must admit I'm interested.",
    "svo0102_052": "I'll show you the ropes if you ever wanna try it out. But for now, I'll just send you today's data. Check it out if you're up for it.",
    "svo0102_053": "Great! Thanks a bunch.",
    "svo0102_054": "I'll let you guys know if I think of any quests I wanna do over. \r\nFeel free to tag along if you'd like!",
    "svo0102_055": "...",
    "svo0102_056": "Something wrong, Quinella?",
    "svo0102_057": "No, it's nothing. \r\nBut weren't you planning to show me around ALO, Kirito? Shall we go?",
    "svo0102_058": "Whoops, sorry! That totally slipped my mind. See you later, guys.",
    "svo0103_001": "*yawn* Man, I'm sleepy. \r\nThat's what I get for losing track of time and playing super late.",
    "svo0103_002": "I want to sleep a bit more, but I really need to study for my upcoming tests...",
    "svo0103_003": "Good morning.",
    "svo0103_004": "Hey there, Quinella. Thanks for yesterday.",
    "svo0103_005": "Want to go to school together?\r\nI'm sure you could use a familiar face, since you just transferred.",
    "svo0103_006": "I can also show you some shortcuts. The quickest route depends on the\r\ntraffic lights, so they're really handy if you're running late.",
    "svo0103_007": "Right... School.",
    "svo0103_008": "There are no Callings in this world, so it's customary for all children to\r\nroutinely go to school, isn't it?",
    "svo0103_009": "Huh? Sorry, didn't catch that.",
    "svo0103_010": "Never mind. Do the people we met yesterday go to the same school as you?",
    "svo0103_011": "Some of them, yeah.\r\nOthers go to different places, and some are adults with actual jobs.",
    "svo0103_012": "Asuna, Silica, and Liz are there, so I'm sure you'll run into them later.",
    "svo0103_013": "Is that so? I must say, you seem to be on rather good terms with them.",
    "svo0103_014": "You were more relaxed than usual when you were around those girls...\r\nOr perhaps that was closer to your true self.",
    "svo0103_015": "I guess I've known them for so long that I feel at home with them.",
    "svo0103_016": "I see. And have you already decided which of them is to be your life partner?",
    "svo0103_017": "Huh?! Wh-Wh-Where'd that question come from?!",
    "svo0103_018": "It is my judgment that the majority of them express affection for you.",
    "svo0103_019": "Wh-Whoa, wait, just hold on a second, Quinella! H-How can you tell?",
    "svo0103_020": "Experience and observation.",
    "svo0103_021": "Does it bring you shame, perhaps?\r\nBut there are many nobles in Underworld who possess numerous concubines.",
    "svo0103_022": "Well, I grew up in The Real World!\r\nI know that's how Underworld and nobles operate, but still!",
    "svo0103_023": "...Huh? How do you know about Underworld?",
    "svo0103_024": "...",
    "svo0103_025": "Were you one of the players who took part in the final battle?\r\nBut that still wouldn't explain how you know about the nobility...",
    "svo0103_026": "What are you going on about? If there is anyone\r\nwho is an expert on Underworld, it would be me.",
    "svo0103_027": "I see... Yeah, I suppose that makes sense now that you point it out.\r\nOf course you'd know all about Underworld.",
    "svo0103_028": "It makes sense, but...",
    "svo0103_029": "Wait, why does it make sense? What is this feeling?\r\nSomething doesn't seem right.",
    "svo0103_030": "Hehe.",
    "svo0103_031": "Quinella?",
    "svo0103_032": "Eheheheheheh... I see.\r\nSo you can sense something is off even if you have forgotten.",
    "svo0103_033": "What are you talking ab—",
    "svo0103_033_2": "Whoa!",
    "svo0103_034": "H-Hey! What do you think you're doing?!",
    "svo0103_035": "An impressive reaction. It appears your skills are sharp as ever.",
    "svo0103_036": "Wait... I'm holding a sword? But why? Isn't this... The Real World?",
    "svo0103_037": "I grant you the right to fight back, boy. Now... Show me a good time!",
    "svo0103_038": "Tch...",
    "svo0103_039": "Yeah, that's right, it's all coming back to me.",
    "svo0103_039_2": "You and I fought like this once before.",
    "svo0103_040": "Now, I remember you... Administrator!",
    "svo0103_041": "...",
    "svo0103_042": "And there's one more thing I figured out. You can't possibly exist in The\r\nReal World under any circumstances—Not in the flesh, anyway.",
    "svo0103_043": "Which means... I'm still in a virtual world.",
    "svo0103_044": "Hehe...",
    "svo0103_045": "Hehehe, hehehehe, ahahahahahahaha!",
    "svo0103_046": "...",
    "svo0103_047": "Congratulations. You have finally awoken.",
    "svo0104_001": "So the story was that you were a transfer student at the school for SAO\r\nsurvivors, was it? Of course, that's impossible.",
    "svo0104_002": "After all, you're supposed to be dead. So what's going on here?",
    "svo0104_003": "...",
    "svo0104_004": "Hold on, did you alter my memories? No, wait a sec...",
    "svo0104_005": "How do I know that you're even really here to begin with? Am I dreaming?\r\nOr is this some kind of illusion someone conjured?",
    "svo0104_006": "...",
    "svo0104_007": "Why don't you say something, Administrator?!",
    "svo0104_008": "...This world was indeed known as Alfheim, wasn't it?",
    "svo0104_009": "Huh...?",
    "svo0104_010": "This world is so lush and green... Much more relaxing than that gray one filled with\r\nall those stone buildings. It reminds me of sights I saw while on the back of wyvern.",
    "svo0104_011": "(She sheathed her sword? Her desire to kill seems to have faded...)",
    "svo0104_012": "Would you kindly cease pointing that thing at me, boy?\r\nOr do you wish to slay an opponent who has no intention to fight?",
    "svo0104_013": "I don't have a clue what's going through your head.",
    "svo0104_014": "Allow me to answer your question. I am neither dream nor illusion.\r\nWhat you see before you is indeed me.",
    "svo0104_015": "That said, I have no means with which to prove this, nor have I any inkling\r\nof how this came to be. It is all quite disconcerting.",
    "svo0104_016": "Huh?",
    "svo0104_017": "When I came to, I was in this world. The last thing I remember is fighting you\r\nto the death in the Central Cathedral.",
    "svo0104_018": "You said I should be dead, did you not? How right you are.\r\nI shouldn't even be here.",
    "svo0104_019": "...",
    "svo0104_020": "You also wondered if I altered your memories? The answer to that is no.\r\nI've laid not a finger on your memories, will, nor soul.",
    "svo0104_021": "So this wasn't your work? Then what happened to me just now?",
    "svo0104_022": "I'm afraid I cannot shed any light on that. By the time I found myself here,\r\nyou were already perceiving me as a fellow transfer student.",
    "svo0104_023": "(It doesn't seem like she's lying, but...)",
    "svo0104_024": "Then what did you do? Why were you with me?",
    "svo0104_025": "I had no idea as to what was happening, nor did I have anything else to do,\r\nand I was interested in this Real World of yours...",
    "svo0104_026": "So I decided to observe you doze through that false dream for a while.\r\nBut, eventually, I tired of it.",
    "svo0104_027": "There is no joy in watching someone you know plod along without their true\r\nmemories.",
    "svo0104_028": "That's rich, coming from you.",
    "svo0104_029": "It was more probable that your memories were temporarily askew,\r\nrather than that you went through some Synthesis-like procedure.",
    "svo0104_030": "So I concluded that if I were to give your memories a little push in the right\r\ndirection, you'd come to your senses. And here we are.",
    "svo0104_031": "So let me get this straight...",
    "svo0104_032": "You have no idea what's going on either, so you figured you'd start by bringing\r\nme back to normal?",
    "svo0104_033": "Good. It appears you haven't gone deaf.",
    "svo0104_034": "...Fine. Then I guess thanks are in order.",
    "svo0104_035": "No, wait, do you really deserve any?\r\nI get the feeling that you struck to kill just a minute ago.",
    "svo0104_036": "Oh, spare me.\r\nNeither of us would be here now if that was all it took to kill you.",
    "svo0104_037": "And I certainly would not have been thwarted in my ambitions.",
    "svo0104_038": "Was that... a compliment?",
    "svo0104_039": "Perhaps? Interpret it as you please.",
    "svo0104_040": "...Anyway, we're getting off track. I now know that this is Alfheim,\r\nand that I haven't logged out yet.",
    "svo0104_041": "But that only leaves me with more questions.",
    "svo0104_042": "Like what's a resident of Underworld doing here?\r\nWhen exactly did my memories get out of whack?",
    "svo0104_043": "And why is all this happening?",
    "svo0104_044": "You are welcome to speculate to your heart's content,\r\nbut perhaps you should keep a closer eye on your surroundings.",
    "svo0104_045": "Huh? Oh crap, monsters!",
    "svo0104_046": "My, oh, my. And so many, too. Not exactly an ideal situation.",
    "svo0104_047": "Hey, wh-where do you think you're going?!",
    "svo0104_048": "Do you want my help?",
    "svo0104_049": "Of course! Even I'm no match for this many!",
    "svo0104_050": "Then ask like you mean it.",
    "svo0104_051": "...Oh, exalted Administrator, will you please lend me a hand?",
    "svo0104_052": "Phew, that was close...",
    "svo0104_053": "That reminds me, I thought people's souls returned to their original bodies\r\nif they die in this realm. Yet you're still frightened of monsters?",
    "svo0104_054": "There are still penalties. No one enjoys dying.",
    "svo0104_055": "(Besides... Something doesn't feel right about this world.\r\nIt's like it is ALO, yet isn't at the same time.)",
    "svo0104_056": "(I can't be sure what'll happen if I die here. Better safe than sorry.)",
    "svo0104_057": "Are there any stronger beasts than the ones so far?\r\nThey've not been much of a challenge.",
    "svo0104_058": "Yeah. There are even some you need dozens of allies to take down.",
    "svo0104_059": "Oh, really? I must say, I'm quite intrigued.",
    "svo0104_060": "At any rate, this is their—I mean, a world your lot created, isn't it?\r\nI wish to explore some more, so serve as my escort and guide.",
    "svo0104_061": "I'm sorry... You want me to be your what?! Why?",
    "svo0104_062": "I lent you my aid. Is it not only fair that you should return the favor?",
    "svo0104_063": "Ugh...",
    "svo0104_064": "Besides, do you not also wish to discover what is behind all this oddness?",
    "svo0104_065": "I take it you see my logic? Splendid. Then let us make haste.",
    "svo0104_066": "Wha... H-Hey, wait!",
    "svo0105_001": "Alfheim, the setting of ALO, has all sorts of terrain.\r\nForests, mountains, deserts—You name it.",
    "svo0105_002": "That's not to say there aren't towns too, but nature remains untouched for the\r\nmost part in this world.",
    "svo0105_003": "I see.",
    "svo0105_004": "(I can't believe I'm actually tagging along with her...)",
    "svo0105_005": "(That said, between her being here and my memories getting all messed up,\r\nit's clear something weird's going on.)",
    "svo0105_006": "(I want to find out what's happening, of course...\r\nBut I'm afraid that it will be worse to let her out of my sight. In more ways than one...)",
    "svo0105_007": "Did you say something?",
    "svo0105_008": "No, not a word.",
    "svo0105_009": "Anyway, we need to find out what's happening to this world right now.\r\nSo we should ask around in the nearest town...",
    "svo0105_010": "Hmm?",
    "svo0105_011": "There are voices coming from over there.",
    "svo0105_012": "For the last time, you've got it all wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!",
    "svo0105_013": "Wh-What she said! We have nothing to do with—",
    "svo0105_014": "Shaddup! Get over here!",
    "svo0105_015": "Sounds like a fight.",
    "svo0105_016": "What do you intend to do about it?",
    "svo0105_017": "Mediate. We should be able to get some information out of them...\r\nAssuming they're players, anyway.",
    "svo0105_018": "Hey, sorry to butt in, but I was wondering if I could ask you—",
    "svo0105_019": "Damn it, they've got more friends?!",
    "svo0105_020": "So what?! We outnumber them!",
    "svo0105_021": "Let's beat 'em all and take 'em away!",
    "svo0105_022": "Huh? Wh-Whoa, hold on!",
    "svo0105_023": "It would appear they are of no mind to be reasoned with.\r\nBe honored for I have deigned to play with you.",
    "svo0105_024": "Crap! These guys are tough!",
    "svo0105_025": "Let's get outta here!",
    "svo0105_026": "Wait hold on! Aw man, they're gone. I didn't even get to ask them anything.",
    "svo0105_027": "Phew, w-we're saved!",
    "svo0105_028": "Th-That was so scary...",
    "svo0105_029": "Glad you guys are okay. What happened? Was there some kind of problem?",
    "svo0105_030": "A big one! Those guys were jerks!\r\nThey just blamed us without even letting us get a word in!",
    "svo0105_031": "Wait, whoops, I should be thanking you first.",
    "svo0105_032": "Thanks for saving us! I'm Fuuka! And this here's Neige, a navigation AI!",
    "svo0105_033": "Th-Thank you so very much.",
    "svo0105_033_1": "Neige is on the large side due to... certain circumstances.",
    "svo0105_033_2": "Circumstances?",
    "svo0105_033_3": "Eh, it's nothing. So, who're you guys?",
    "svo0105_034": "I'm Kirito. And this lady is...",
    "svo0105_035": "...Quinella.",
    "svo0105_036": "Kirito and Quinella, eh? Boy, you really saved our hides!",
    "svo0105_037": "I was freaking out when that murderous mob came all ready to kill us,\r\nbut wow, you two are tough!",
    "svo0105_038": "They sure looked ticked off. What's the story?",
    "svo0105_039": "Well, we were searching this area when suddenly all these players got together\r\nand started making a ruckus.",
    "svo0105_040": "I was curious what the deal was, so I eavesdropped and learned that\r\nthere's this really nasty PK around here.",
    "svo0105_041": "A PK?",
    "svo0105_042": "A Player Killer. It's what they call a murderer in this world.",
    "svo0105_043": "ALO allows for that sort of thing, but there are still unspoken rules\r\nand etiquette people are expected to follow.",
    "svo0105_044": "Hmm... It sure is inconvenient they don't have a Taboo Index.",
    "svo0105_045": "Taboo what now?",
    "svo0105_046": "Oh nothing, she's just talking to herself. So go on, what happened next?",
    "svo0105_047": "Right, well, we didn't wanna get mixed up in all that,\r\nso we tried to leave, but I screwed up and was spotted...",
    "svo0105_048": "Then they started accusing us of being PKs.\r\nThey figured that was the only reason we'd be sneaking around.",
    "svo0105_049": "Talk about jumping the gun.",
    "svo0105_050": "I know, right?! That's one hell of an accusation to make on the spot!\r\nAm I right, or am I right, Neige?!",
    "svo0105_051": "Y-Yes.",
    "svo0105_052": "It is as she says. We're innocent. But they wouldn't hear us out...",
    "svo0105_053": "I see. Really sucks you had to go through that.",
    "svo0105_054": "Wait, you believe us? Just like that? Seriously?",
    "svo0105_055": "Well, I can't exactly picture a navigation AI lying to cover for a player.",
    "svo0105_056": "Oh, right, that makes sense.",
    "svo0105_057": "Besides, we were looking for someone to talk to anyway. So...\r\nHas anything seemed strange in this world to you?",
    "svo0105_058": "What do you mean? Did something weird happen with you guys?",
    "svo0105_059": "You could say that. First my memories got all messed up, then I found myself\r\nin a freaky VR world when I was supposed to be logged into ALO...",
    "svo0105_060": "He even encountered someone who by all means shouldn't have been there.",
    "svo0105_061": "Oh, is that what happened?",
    "svo0105_062": "It sounds to me as though this is ringing a bell to you.",
    "svo0105_063": "N-Nah, nothing like that. However...",
    "svo0105_064": "If you know something, could you please share it with us?",
    "svo0105_065": "...Sure, okay. You DID save us, so yeah, I'll fill you in on what we know!",
    "svo0105_066": "Fuuka...",
    "svo0105_067": "Relax, lemme handle this.",
    "svo0105_068": "First things first, I think you should know a little more about me.",
    "svo0105_069": "Like I said, my name is Fuuka. But I'm not an ALO player,\r\nI'm a tester for an extension that's under development.",
    "svo0105_070": "As for Neige...",
    "svo0105_071": "I am both a navigation pixie and a Support AI assisting with development.",
    "svo0105_071_1": "She's changed her avatar size for development support purposes.",
    "svo0105_071_2": "Huh, I didn't know you could adjust that.",
    "svo0105_072": "So anyway, what's this extension you're talking about?",
    "svo0105_073": "Galaxia, where you revisit your memories and turn your past into new experiences\r\nin your present!",
    "svo0106_001": "Galaxia...",
    "svo0106_002": "You know about it? Have you used it before?",
    "svo0106_003": "Yeah. It allows you to recreate and revisit the past, right?",
    "svo0106_004": "It's supposed to be really popular, too...\r\nSo you're involved in its development, huh?",
    "svo0106_005": "Eh, kinda. I mean, being a tester's just a part-time job for me.",
    "svo0106_006": "They're working to upgrade it now that it's been officially released,\r\nso I'm just helping out with that.",
    "svo0106_007": "So anyway, I came out to this field here for another day of testing...\r\nBut that's when a system error occurred with Galaxia.",
    "svo0106_008": "The world was covered in static and everything went dark...\r\nBy the time I came to, Neige and I were standing in that meadow over there.",
    "svo0106_009": "So Galaxia's responsible for all this weird stuff? Is that what you're saying?",
    "svo0106_010": "Hmm... Exactly! Maybe! No! Perhaps... Beats me.",
    "svo0106_011": "Don't get me wrong, there's definitely a bug in Galaxia,\r\nbut that doesn't guarantee it's to blame for everything.",
    "svo0106_012": "Then it's possible something else caused this,\r\nand this outcome is one of the consequences?",
    "svo0106_013": "Bingo! I don't know jack about programming,\r\nso I haven't got a clue about what the issue is.",
    "svo0106_014": "Neige's link to the system was cut when Galaxia started going all crazy,\r\nso she can't even use most of her functions.",
    "svo0106_015": "I'm so sorry I can't be of any help.",
    "svo0106_016": "But anyway, that's why I'm hoping I can ask you guys a favor.",
    "svo0106_017": "What is it?",
    "svo0106_018": "Think you could be my muscle?",
    "svo0106_019": "What does she mean by \"muscle\"?",
    "svo0106_020": "It's like slang for bodyguard.",
    "svo0106_021": "Exactly. What I'm using is an avatar meant for testing Galaxia,\r\nso it's not made for fighting.",
    "svo0106_022": "So if some players come after me again or a tough monster attacks,\r\nI'll have no way of dealing with them.",
    "svo0106_023": "Yes, she's right.\r\nIt would indeed be reassuring to have you escorting us on the way over.",
    "svo0106_024": "Sounds like you've got a destination in mind.",
    "svo0106_025": "I believe it would be for the best if we were to return to the Test Room.\r\nDon't you agree, Fuuka?",
    "svo0106_026": "Mmm... Yeah, good idea. I've gotta check the area and write up a bug report on\r\nmy way back.",
    "svo0106_027": "Oh, right, the Test Room's, uh... A room for testing!",
    "svo0106_028": "I believe that was self-explanatory...",
    "svo0106_029": "More specifically, it is an area in ALO our company provided us so that we can\r\ntest and adjust Galaxia.",
    "svo0106_030": "Since it's a development base, there should be a staff member stationed there right now.",
    "svo0106_031": "Yep! It's probably gotta be somewhere in this world.",
    "svo0106_032": "Sure, I don't mind taking you there... Wait, what did you mean by that last\r\npart? Are you telling me you don't even know where it is?",
    "svo0106_033": "How can that be?\r\nSurely with a navi pixie you should know its location and how to get there...",
    "svo0106_034": "I'm terribly sorry... I wish I could...",
    "svo0106_035": "But just as she explained, I have been disconnected from the system,\r\nso I have no means with which to determine its current location.",
    "svo0106_036": "Oh man, that's not good. Though I guess we're just as lost as you...",
    "svo0106_037": "...!",
    "svo0106_038": "...!",
    "svo0106_039": "F-Fuuka! Pursuers from the rear!",
    "svo0106_040": "I-It's those jerks, isn't it?! They just don't know when to quit.",
    "svo0106_041": "That's not all! There's more of them this time!",
    "svo0106_042": "They must have brought backup.\r\nLet's just relax and try to talk it out with them fir—",
    "svo0106_042_2": "Whoa!",
    "svo0106_043": "We've caught them! You're the PK suspects, aren't you?!\r\nLay down your arms and surrender if you don't want a beating!",
    "svo0106_044": "L-Leafa?!",
    "svo0106_045": "(Wait, hold on... Is it just me, or is something off about her?)",
    "svo0106_046": "Hey, Leafa! It's me! Don't you recognize me?!",
    "svo0106_047": "Save your breath, Player Killer! Raaaaaagh!",
    "svo0106_048": "Ah, crap... Is fighting seriously our only option?!",
    "svo0106_049": "Damn it, what's gotten into you?! Calm down!",
    "svo0106_049_2": "Sugu!",
    "svo0106_050": "...",
    "svo0106_051": "...Huh? What in the...?",
    "svo0106_052": "Wait, is that you, Bro?!",
    "svo0106_053": "Of course it's me! Don't you recognize your own brother?!",
    "svo0106_054": "S-Sorry! Wait, why'd it take me so long to notice?",
    "svo0106_055": "The others are fleeing. What is the plan?",
    "svo0106_056": "Let them go. At least Leafa can fill us in.",
    "svo0106_057": "Uh, Bro—I mean, Kirito—you're the PK suspect?",
    "svo0106_058": "No. It's these two behind me.",
    "svo0106_059": "Hey, I'm innocent! Innocent, I tell ya! What about being innocent until proven guilty?\r\nWhere's our chance to defend ourse—Wait... how mean, Kirito! I thought you believed me!",
    "svo0106_060": "Haha, I'm just kidding. Anyway, all joking aside...",
    "svo0106_061": "The two of them are only suspects. So could you take it down a notch, Leafa?",
    "svo0106_062": "W-We really were just passing by. We have no idea who the PK is...",
    "svo0106_063": "Hmm... Well, I guess you two don't look like the types to cause trouble.",
    "svo0106_064": "Anyway, what were you doing, Leafa? Why were you part of that mob?",
    "svo0106_065": "See, here's the thing: I was out grinding with Asuna and the others when\r\neverything suddenly went black. When I came to, I'd been tossed here all by\r\nmyself.",
    "svo0106_066": "Weirdest thing was, I can't get in touch with the others for some reason.\r\nThere were several other people in the same boat nearby, but we didn't know\r\nwhat to do.",
    "svo0106_067": "While we were talking, we heard someone shouting in the distance about how\r\nsomeone had been attacked or killed, so we all panicked.",
    "svo0106_068": "And when that happened... my mind got all fuzzy for some reason.",
    "svo0106_069": "You didn't see where the player was killed, did you?",
    "svo0106_070": "No. It's weird, thinking back on it.",
    "svo0106_071": "I can't believe I suspected and attacked those two on such flimsy grounds.\r\nI'm really sorry for overreacting like that...",
    "svo0106_072": "Oh, no, that's okay! Just as long as we're all on the same page now.",
    "svo0106_073": "I guess we all sort of lost our cool because there's never been a bug like this\r\nbefore.",
    "svo0106_074": "In any case, I believe it would be best for a change in venue before any further\r\ncommotion invites itself upon us.",
    "svo0106_075": "Yeah, good thinking. There may be monsters around,\r\nbut I'm sure we can take anything we'll find here.",
    "svo0106_076": "Well, then let me lead the way, Kirito. I'll guide you all from the sky!",
    "svo0106_077": "This way, guys! Keep going straight!",
    "svo0106_078": "Phew, we should be safe here. Boy, am I beat!",
    "svo0106_079": "Leafa, guys, thanks. You were all a big help.",
    "svo0106_080": "Tell that to my aching legs! I'm not used to so much running away...",
    "svo0106_081": "Why don't we do some training together the next chance we get?",
    "svo0106_082": "Now that we have a moment to breathe, let's pick up where we left off.\r\nFirst of all, what are you guys doing here?",
    "svo0106_083": "I get it now. So in short, you and Quinella bumped into Fuuka and Neige,\r\nand helped them out.",
    "svo0106_084": "Hey, uh, Leafa, I know this is gonna sound weird, but...",
    "svo0106_085": "What is it?",
    "svo0106_086": "This is the first time you've met Quinella, isn't it?",
    "svo0106_087": "Huh? Yeah, though I may've passed her in ALO without knowing it. Why do you ask?",
    "svo0106_088": "Wait, this IS the first time we've met... isn't it?",
    "svo0106_089": "Indeed. To you, that is.",
    "svo0106_090": "Huh?",
    "svo0106_091": "Don't confuse her, Quinella.",
    "svo0106_092": "(That part where we all used Galaxia and were sent Leafa's data probably\r\nhappened for real.)",
    "svo0106_093": "(However, the part where I introduced the Administrator to them all wasn't real,\r\nbut rather an illusion added to the recreation.)",
    "svo0106_094": "In other words, I started up Galaxia at some point, \r\nand it read in the data I got from Leafa.",
    "svo0106_095": "But it was then that some kind of error occurred with the system.",
    "svo0106_096": "It was likely thanks to that that I lost my memories about Galaxia\r\nand re-experienced the past recorded in that data alongside you...",
    "svo0106_097": "...and then mistook that for reality.",
    "svo0106_098": "But since I'm not supposed to exist in reality, you unconsciously assigned me\r\nthe role of \"transfer student\" so it would all make sense in your head.",
    "svo0106_099": "The human brain can be a fascinatingly flexible wonder at times.\r\nIt will even supplement any blanks on its own whenever an error due to\r\ninformation loss is about to occur.",
    "svo0106_100": "...I'm glad one of us had fun at my expense.\r\nAnyway, that's probably what happened to me, yes. But...",
    "svo0106_101": "No, forget it.",
    "svo0106_102": "(This doesn't mean the Administrator's totally in the clear.)",
    "svo0106_103": "(Why is it that she's right here when she's not supposed to really exist?)",
    "svo0106_104": "(That can't be just an error with the Galaxia's system, can it?)",
    "svo0106_105": "...",
    "svo0106_106": "U-Um... What're you guys talking about?",
    "svo0106_107": "Just about a little bit of a problem I had because of the error.\r\nI'm all better now, though.",
    "svo0106_108": "(Explaining my relationship with the Administrator to Leafa won't do me any\r\ngood. Guess I'll just have to pass her off as someone I know in-game.)",
    "svo0106_109": "Still, this isn't good. How long do you think it'll be till they resolve this\r\nissue?",
    "svo0106_110": "Could you two tell us the Galaxia developers' opinions?",
    "svo0106_111": "No clue!",
    "svo0106_112": "That isn't something you should sound so proud of, Fuuka...",
    "svo0106_113": "Well, what can I say? The two of us are just a tester and an AI assistant.\r\nNot like we're programmers or anything.",
    "svo0106_114": "That said, I don't think you need to start getting all doom and gloom about it\r\neither. I'm sure they'll have it fixed in a jiffy.",
    "svo0106_115": "Say, if the problem is with the Galaxia system error, then we can ask that staff\r\nmember for an ETA, right? As long as we find the Test Room, I mean.",
    "svo0106_116": "Hey, mind if I tag along? I wanna know too.",
    "svo0106_117": "Sure, welcome aboard!",
    "svo0106_118": "That would actually be a great help to us... Thank you so much.",
    "svo0106_119": "No problem!",
    "svo0106_120": "I believe that is quite enough chatter.",
    "svo0106_121": "We've already expended a lot of time, so we should set forth.\r\nI still wish to have a look at this world.",
    "svo0106_122": "Okay, okay, I'll tag along.",
    "svo0106_123": "Ooh, lemme get in on this too. Maybe I'll get a raise if I give my bosses a\r\nwhole mountain of bug reports!",
    "svo0106_124": "You can't be in this only for yourself, Fuuka. Let's get back to the Test Room\r\nwith as few detours as possible.",
    "svo0107_001": "Ugh... I've been walking for hours now, and there's still no town...",
    "svo0107_002": "Where's Glocken? And for that matter, where am I?",
    "svo0107_003": "Hey, Fuka! Fukaziroh!",
    "svo0107_004": "Where the heck could she have gone? We were supposed to grind together...",
    "svo0107_005": "It's okay, keep your cool. Maybe I'm the one who got separated from Fuka.",
    "svo0107_006": "I mean, I don't recognize this terrain at all...\r\nDoes that mean I got teleported against my will?",
    "svo0107_007": "Grrr...",
    "svo0107_008": "If so, then maybe I triggered some kind of event? Still, that doesn't change how\r\nscary it is to be sent somewhere unfamiliar all alone...",
    "svo0107_009": "Grrrgh!",
    "svo0107_010": "Fuka, Pito, M... Is anyone there?",
    "svo0107_011": "Grrrrrgh!",
    "svo0107_012": "Shut up already!",
    "svo0107_013": "Gyah!?",
    "svo0107_014": "Phew. But even if I'm alone, I can't forget no good comes from pessimism.",
    "svo0107_015": "Gotta think positive. No matter what kind of event this was...",
    "svo0107_016": "All I need to do to progress is kill enemies. Probably.",
    "svo0107_017": "I've taken care of the enemies in the vicinity, but I get the feeling more will\r\ngroup up.",
    "svo0107_018": "Isn't there anywhere easy to fight nearby?",
    "svo0107_019": "Ugh, I'm surrounded. Strength in numbers is so unfair.",
    "svo0107_020": "Good news is that I have a base. Bad news is that this fight is gonna turn into\r\na siege. I wonder how many I can take down with me.",
    "svo0107_021": "Wait, what?",
    "svo0107_022": "What's that in the distance? Is someone there?",
    "svo0107_023": "No, it could just be a humanoid monster. Besides, even if it is a player,\r\nthere's no guarantee they're on my side. What should I do?",
    "svo0107_024": "I came here because I sensed a battle. Are those beasts attacking someone?\r\nIs that... a girl?",
    "svo0107_025": "No, wait... The girl's the one attacking the beasts?\r\nAnd what's that weapon she's using? Some sort of projectile?",
    "svo0107_026": "Such agility... And she's taking down every last one of them, too.\r\nI've never seen even an advanced knight pull off moves like that.",
    "svo0107_027": "Still, she's outnumbered... All right, that settles it. I'll back her up.",
    "svo0107_028": "She is the first person I've seen since coming here, after all.",
    "svo0108_001": "I'll just take care to avoid that weapon's line of fire while breaking through\r\nthe enemy circle from the outside.",
    "svo0108_002": "Then I'll draw the beasts' attention, break through the center of the horde\r\nat the opportune moment, and team up with that girl... \r\nYeah, that sounds like a plan.",
    "svo0108_003": "I've finally found someone who might have answers,\r\nso I can't let this chance pass me by.",
    "svo0108_004": "Come on, beasts! She's not your only enemy here!",
    "svo0108_005": "Grrr? Gaaaaah!",
    "svo0108_006": "Yeaaaaah!",
    "svo0108_007": "There sure are a lot of them. I'll veer off this way and take a few down as\r\nI go.",
    "svo0108_008": "It may take some time, but it's still better than luring those beasts to that\r\ngirl.",
    "svo0108_009": "Good, the enemy's faltering. Now's my chance to break through the circle—",
    "svo0108_010": "Whoa!",
    "svo0108_011": "Eeep!",
    "svo0108_012": "(Oh no... I came charging exactly when that girl started running.\r\nNow, it's going to look like...)",
    "svo0108_013": "(...Like I'm trying to stab her.)",
    "svo0108_014": "...",
    "svo0108_015": "E-Excuse me...",
    "svo0108_016": "Uh—",
    "svo0108_017": "Ahh! I knew it! You're here to kill me!",
    "svo0108_018": "What... N-No, no, you've got it all wrong! Wait!",
    "svo0108_019": "Don't come any closer!",
    "svo0108_020": "(Well, this isn't good. It's going to be hard to talk to her now.)",
    "svo0108_021": "I didn't want to do this, but it looks like I'll have to get a bit rough.",
    "svo0108_021_2": "Enhance Armament!",
    "svo0108_022": "Huh? Whoa, wh-what is that? Ice?! Eeep!",
    "svo0108_023": "Phew...",
    "svo0108_024": "I didn't think I could beat you in mobility, and I couldn't have you running\r\naway on me, so I froze the ground and your legs for now.",
    "svo0108_025": "...",
    "svo0108_026": "Wh-Whoa, hey, wait! Put down your weapon! I don't want to fight anymore!",
    "svo0108_027": "These don't look like freezing bullets...\r\nI've never seen anything like this before in GGO.",
    "svo0108_028": "What is this, magic? That's a pretty weird sword you've got too.\r\nDid I get sent to the world of ALO or something?",
    "svo0108_029": "I-I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about...",
    "svo0108_030": "But, umm... What's your name?",
    "svo0108_031": "...It's LLENN.",
    "svo0108_032": "I apologize for getting rough with you, LLENN.\r\nBut let me assure you I mean you no harm. I just want to talk.",
    "svo0108_033": "Talk? About what?",
    "svo0108_034": "Well... So basically, you found yourself in this world when you awoke and have\r\nno idea where you are.",
    "svo0108_035": "Yes. That's why I was wondering if you could tell me about the area.\r\nLike if there are any towns or villages nearby.",
    "svo0108_036": "Hate to break it to you, but I don't think I'm gonna be much help.\r\nI'm in the same situation, you see. I can't even find my friend...",
    "svo0108_037": "I see...",
    "svo0108_038": "Say, would you mind if I accompanied you for a while? There seem to be dangerous\r\nbeasts in the vicinity, so I think it'd be for the best if we teamed up against\r\nthem.",
    "svo0108_039": "...",
    "svo0108_040": "Yeah, good point. All right, let's do it.",
    "svo0108_041": "Thank you. Oh, right... I never did give you my name, did I?",
    "svo0108_042": "I'm Eugeo. It's nice to meet you, LLENN.",
    "svo0109_001": "...I remember I was going up the Central Cathedral.",
    "svo0109_002": "But my memory's a blur after that. The next thing I recall is standing here all\r\nby myself with no clue what happened in-between.",
    "svo0109_003": "What's the Central Cathedral? Is that a town or something?",
    "svo0109_004": "No, it's this giant tower in Centoria that's the headquarters of the\r\nAxiom Church. Have you never heard of it?",
    "svo0109_005": "Nope, never. Sorry.",
    "svo0109_006": "Right.",
    "svo0109_007": "(Is he talking about some kind of fantasy game? It's at times like these\r\nI wish I knew more about this kind of stuff. Maybe Fuka would have an idea?)",
    "svo0109_008": "I really don't have time for this. I need to defeat the Administrator and\r\nsave...",
    "svo0109_009": "No, calm down. Impatience won't solve anything.",
    "svo0109_010": "(Maybe he was in the middle of some kind of event?\r\nIt could just be me, but he sounds like one of those hardcore roleplayer types,\r\nthough he doesn't seem like a bad guy.)",
    "svo0109_011": "What about you? Do you have any idea what's to blame for all of this?",
    "svo0109_012": "Well, one minute I was out grinding near town with my friend,\r\nthen the next thing I knew, I was here. So honestly, no. I've got nothing.",
    "svo0109_013": "I may not be in a rush or anything, but I'm a bit worried about my friend,\r\nso I'd like to find her as soon as I can.",
    "svo0109_013_1": "It sounds like you care a lot about her. I hope she's all right.",
    "svo0109_013_2": "If anything, I'm more worried about what mischief she could be up to even as\r\nwe speak.",
    "svo0109_014": "...",
    "svo0109_014_2": "Well, why don't we just try to find a settlement—\r\nHuh?",
    "svo0109_015": "You hear that too, don't you?",
    "svo0109_016": "Argggh, cut it out already!\r\nHow many times do I gotta tell you to leave us alone?!",
    "svo0109_017": "Grrr.",
    "svo0109_018": "I don't think we can shake 'em. Ready yourself, cause we're gonna have to fight.",
    "svo0109_019": "You talk a big game, but do you really think we stand a chance against so many?",
    "svo0109_020": "Fighting ain't about what ya do or who wins! It's in the heart!\r\nConfidence or no, all you need to fight is the will to strike back!",
    "svo0109_021": "Argo...",
    "svo0109_022": "...That said, it's great if ya wanna fight and all,\r\nbut strength's a totally different can of worms.",
    "svo0109_023": "...And here I thought you actually sounded cool for once.",
    "svo0109_024": "Hey, cut me some slack, ya know I'm an information broker.\r\nMy specialty's playing hide and seek, not fightin' face-ta-face.",
    "svo0109_025": "Not that that's gonna stop me from fightin' like hell.\r\nAin't exactly looking for an early grave here myself.",
    "svo0109_026": "Agh, screw it, let's just do this! Hey, monsters! Come and get some!",
    "svo0109_027": "Grrrrrawrgh!",
    "svo0109_028": "Huh?",
    "svo0109_029": "What?",
    "svo0109_030": "Hey you guys! We're here to help!",
    "svo0109_031": "Let's drive these beasts off together! We need to work as one!",
    "svo0109_032": "...!",
    "svo0109_033": "Argo! Let's take 'em up on that!",
    "svo0109_034": "Roger! Why don't we start with the extra ugly monster in front of us?",
    "svo0109_035": "Hey, thanks for the backup, uh... Wait, who're you guys?",
    "svo0109_036": "My name is Eugeo. And she's LLENN.",
    "svo0109_037": "Thanks a ton! I'm Lisbeth, and this here's Argo.",
    "svo0109_038": "Hang on, this ain't exactly the place for a meet and greet.\r\nThere's still monsters gathering.",
    "svo0109_039": "We'll be sitting ducks if we stand and fight! Let's find someplace safe!",
    "svo0109_040": "Oh, no! Look! Something's coming this way!",
    "svo0109_041": "H-Hey! Nobody told me about this!",
    "svo0109_042": "Hoo boy. Wasn't expectin' ta find something so huge.",
    "svo0109_043": "Pull yourselves together and focus your attacks!",
    "svo0109_044": "We did it! We survived!",
    "svo0109_045": "Sure didn't look like fate was gonna swing in our favor for a moment...",
    "svo0109_046": "Uh... LLENN and Eugeo, right? Thanks! I know I've already told you this,\r\nbut I'm Lisbeth. I fight with a mace and work mainly as a blacksmith.",
    "svo0109_047": "And I'm Argo, information broker supreme.",
    "svo0109_048": "I'm glad we got to you in time. It's such a relief you're unharmed.",
    "svo0109_049": "It appears this area is cleared of beasts now, so why don't we take\r\na little breather?",
    "svo0109_050": "...I see, so you found yourselves here all alone without remembering how you got\r\nhere? We truly are in the same uncharted waters, then.",
    "svo0109_051": "Gotta wonder what the heck's happening here... Hey Argo, you got any clue?",
    "svo0109_052": "Information brokers shine at times like these where nary a clue is to be found,\r\nright?",
    "svo0109_053": "I'm good, but I'm not that good. It all happened so fast that I'm just as lost\r\nas you are.",
    "svo0109_054": "But that said, now's the perfect time to start piecing together whatever\r\ninformation I can. So LLENN, that outfit's from GGO, right?",
    "svo0109_055": "Yeah.",
    "svo0109_056": "I was playing ALO. I ended up here right as I was in the middle of killing\r\nmonsters.",
    "svo0109_057": "The fact this involves both ALO and GGO players means that whatever's goin' down\r\nmust be affecting the Seed Nexus on a pretty wide scale.",
    "svo0109_058": "And as for why this is happenin'... I actually heard there was some kind of\r\nstrange error on Galaxia's server not too long ago.",
    "svo0109_059": "Oh wait, first things first. Do y'all know about Galaxia?",
    "svo0109_060": "Fuka—oh, that's one of my friends—told me about it. I think it's some kind of\r\nextension that's been implemented into VR worlds that originated from the\r\nSeed Nexus.",
    "svo0109_061": "She said it allows you to experience super-realistic recreations of the past...",
    "svo0109_062": "Leafa had me try it out, actually.",
    "svo0109_063": "I admit I'm not really following all of this...\r\nBut basically this is all Galaxia's fault?",
    "svo0109_064": "I can't say for sure without any proof,\r\nbut that function sure is fishy.",
    "svo0109_065": "It's like a completely unofficial black box for the whole system...",
    "svo0109_066": "A software company was commissioned to make it,\r\nbut their client's a total mystery.",
    "svo0109_067": "...",
    "svo0109_068": "Eugeo?",
    "svo0109_069": "Huh? Oh, sorry. I was just thinking, that's all.",
    "svo0109_070": "(I've probably ended up in an entirely different world altogether.\r\nThere are just far too many terms and concepts I've never even heard of.)",
    "svo0109_071": "(At the very least, none of the blacksmiths or artisans I know could have\r\ncrafted LLENN's weapon and armor.)",
    "svo0109_072": "*sigh* This isn't good. Now I'm the one who is a Lost Child of Vecta, huh?",
    "svo0109_073": "Did Kirito feel this scared too?",
    "svo0109_074": "Kirito?!",
    "svo0109_075": "Kirito?!",
    "svo0109_076": "Whoa! Y-You gave me a heart attack...",
    "svo0109_077": "Whoops! Sorry for shouting.",
    "svo0109_078": "Anyway, you just said \"Kirito,\" right, Eugeo?! Are we thinking of the same Kirito?!",
    "svo0109_079": "I-I'm not sure what Kirito you're referring to, but the Kirito I know is an\r\nAincrad Style swordsman with black clothes and hair.",
    "svo0109_080": "Aincrad?! Then it really is the same Kirito!",
    "svo0109_081": "Mmm, sounds likely to me. Really is a small world after all, huh?",
    "svo0109_082": "You two know Kirito as well?! Does that mean he also ended up in this world?",
    "svo0109_083": "I'm not sure, but I'd sure like to see him again if he did.",
    "svo0109_084": "If you ask me, this messed up situation sounds like the\r\nperfect place to show everyone what he's made of.",
    "svo0109_085": "You took the words right out of my mouth! He can be so decisive and resourceful\r\nsometimes. I'm sure he'd be a great help if he were here.",
    "svo0109_086": "...",
    "svo0109_087": "Huh? Is it just me, or am I out of the loop here?",
    "svo0109_088": "We can win if we work together!",
    "svo0110_001": "Y-Yes, of course we have all sorts of rules. Protecting the players comes first.",
    "svo0110_002": "I'm sure this could be said of all VR compatible software and hardware,\r\nnot just Galaxia...",
    "svo0110_003": "...But just because we can intervene with the players' senses doesn't mean that\r\nwe manipulate everything they're feeling as we plea—",
    "svo0110_004": "But you avoid that strictly for moral reasons, right? Which means you should be\r\nable to do even more than that on a technological level. Am I wrong?",
    "svo0110_005": "W-Well... No, you are correct. But still...",
    "svo0110_006": "Oh, don't get me wrong, I am not criticizing you. Far from it.",
    "svo0110_007": "Human sensations are exceedingly delicate and vary greatly by individual.",
    "svo0110_008": "So to hear there is a machine that can uniformly stimulate them however you wish\r\nin spite of that is quite fascinating...",
    "svo0110_009": "Hey, Bro, is Quinella a neurologist? A VR researcher? Or a technician?\r\nSomething like that?",
    "svo0110_010": "Hmm, uh... Well, I guess I can't say she's never done work like that before...",
    "svo0110_011": "(Administrator's taken to this place like a fish to water. Why do I get the\r\nfeeling it won't be long before she understands more than we do?)",
    "svo0110_012": "(She has a real thirst for knowledge and is quick on the uptake.\r\nPerhaps that's exactly why she was so successful in Underworld.)",
    "svo0110_013": "Hey Quinella, why don't you leave it at that for now?\r\nCan't you see you're overwhelming Neige?",
    "svo0110_014": "Kirito...",
    "svo0110_015": "Besides, listening to you really delve into the latest technology is giving me\r\nall kinds of concern. What're you planning on doing with all that info?",
    "svo0110_016": "Oh my, I'm hurt. I am motivated purely by curiosity, nothing more.",
    "svo0110_017": "Yeah, I don't know if I buy that... Wait, huh?\r\nWhy's Fuuka waving her hands in the distance?",
    "svo0110_018": "Hey, I think I found something. Let's check it out.",
    "svo0110_019": "...",
    "svo0110_020": "...",
    "svo0110_021": "H-Hey, what's with that look?",
    "svo0110_022": "It's the look of a guy trying to figure out what you did to end up in a cage,\r\nKlein.",
    "svo0110_023": "Oh, so you two know each other?",
    "svo0110_024": "Uh, what the heck are you doing in there, Klein?",
    "svo0110_025": "Wait, hear me out before you say anything!",
    "svo0110_026": "I got separated from my Fuurinkazan buddies at some point,\r\nso I wandered around on my own until I found a treasure chest.",
    "svo0110_027": "I tried to open it, but then this freaking cage fell right on top of me!",
    "svo0110_028": "A trap? Good thing it wasn't the instant death kind.",
    "svo0110_029": "Think we can break this from the outside?",
    "svo0110_030": "Well, it seems to be a breakable object, at least.\r\nMight take some elbow grease to pull it apart, though.",
    "svo0110_031": "Don't you worry, Klime—Or was it Klein? Whatever.\r\nEither way, the four of us can break it like—",
    "svo0110_032": "Wait.",
    "svo0110_033": "Huh? What's up, Kirito?",
    "svo0110_034": "Well, I'm just wondering why this trap's here to begin with.",
    "svo0110_035": "Think of damaging and instant death traps in dungeons, for example.\r\nThey're meant to keep you from getting in, right?",
    "svo0110_036": "Then what about this one? What's a capture trap doing in these parts?",
    "svo0110_037": "I see. So you think he's bait?",
    "svo0110_038": "Bait?",
    "svo0110_039": "Imprisoning someone would likely drive their friends to mount a rescue, correct?",
    "svo0110_040": "Yeah, that sounds about right.",
    "svo0110_041": "Which means you can lure out many by capturing one,\r\nincreasing the number of prey you can ensnare.",
    "svo0110_042": "It is the sort of plan I could see a beast of above average intelligence\r\nconceiving.",
    "svo0110_043": "Yeah. Which means we're in for...",
    "svo0110_044": "Eeep... M-Monsters coming right this way! They have us surrounded!",
    "svo0110_045": "Oh crap... I-I'm sure you've got this, Kiridude!",
    "svo0110_046": "Phew, that's all of them...",
    "svo0110_047": "You owe me one.",
    "svo0110_048": "Yeah, of course! A man never forgets his debts!",
    "svo0110_049": "Hey, Kirito...",
    "svo0110_050": "Yeah?",
    "svo0110_051": "Who're the ladies?",
    "svo0110_052": "I see, so you're Fuuka and Neige? Thanks for saving my skin!",
    "svo0110_053": "No worries, I'm just glad you're okay!",
    "svo0110_054": "Same goes for you too.",
    "svo0110_055": "...",
    "svo0110_056": "You said your name was Quinella, right? You're really pretty.",
    "svo0110_057": "You fought so elegantly that even I, the one and only Klein,\r\nmust admit I admire your talent.",
    "svo0110_058": "Klein tends to get... loopy from time to time. Usually he's fine, though.",
    "svo0110_059": "Mmm, it's kind of like an illness, really.",
    "svo0110_060": "The way you so beautifully cut down those monsters was just like the legendary\r\nValkyries! Or a lone flower blooming on the—",
    "svo0110_061": "Yes, so you already told me.",
    "svo0110_062": "Wait... I did?",
    "svo0110_063": "Your compliments aside, I find it unbearable how greatly your command of\r\nlanguage resembles Chudelkin's. Do keep it in check.",
    "svo0110_064": "U-Uh, have we met or something?\r\nI don't think I'd ever forget a girl like you...",
    "svo0110_065": "Hey! Q-Quinella! Wait!",
    "svo0110_066": "Ahahahahaha, what a funny guy!",
    "svo0110_067": "You shouldn't laugh so hard, Fuuka...",
    "svo0110_068": "All right, let's hit the road.",
    "svo0111_001": "I see... I thought something was off, but now it makes sense.\r\nSo that's what happened...",
    "svo0111_002": "How long's it gonna take till things are back to normal?",
    "svo0111_003": "No idea. There's probably never been a bug like this before.",
    "svo0111_004": "Neige, what about you and Fuuka? Aren't you part of the dev staff?",
    "svo0111_005": "Technically, but my role is limited to support, while Fuuka is just an\r\noutsourced tester.",
    "svo0111_006": "Though the Test Room is constantly manned by a staff member,\r\nI cannot get in touch with them due to the system errors.",
    "svo0111_007": "You gotta be kidding me...",
    "svo0111_008": "I'm terribly sorry to be of no help...",
    "svo0111_009": "Wait, no, I wasn't blaming you, sorry if it sounded that way. It's not your\r\nfault. Look, it's precisely when things look bleak that we gotta stay positive.\r\nDon't you agree?",
    "svo0111_010": "If you say so...",
    "svo0111_011": "By the way, just what exactly does a tester do?",
    "svo0111_012": "Usually, they check if a program is working the way it is supposed to.\r\nThey do so by actually trying it out and watching for any bugs.",
    "svo0111_013": "Just—",
    "svo0111_014": "I'm kind of a special case.",
    "svo0111_015": "Oh, Fuuka. Didn't know you were back.",
    "svo0111_016": "Where'd you go?",
    "svo0111_017": "I went to scout ahead.\r\nUnfortunately, there's nothing but meadows as far as the eye can see.",
    "svo0111_018": "So what you are saying is that this identical scenery continues on and on.",
    "svo0111_019": "...I tire of this.",
    "svo0111_020": "Weird... we should be coming up on a town by now.\r\nYou think the map itself has changed big time?",
    "svo0111_021": "Much as I'd rather not think about it,\r\nthat's probably the most likely assumption to make. Oh well.\r\nGuess all we can do is keep going until we bump into something.",
    "svo0111_022": "We could have flown over all of this already if we only had a dragon...",
    "svo0111_023": "(Uh-oh, someone's in a bad mood...)",
    "svo0111_024": "U-uh, hey, Fuuka was saying something before. What makes you a special case?",
    "svo0111_025": "Huh? Oh, right, see, my body's a little different from others.\r\nHave you ever heard the term \"overfitting\" before?",
    "svo0111_026": "I think so... It has something to do with adapting to VR, right?",
    "svo0111_027": "Yep. In a broad sense, it's classified as FNC—FullDive Non-Conformity—but it's\r\nnot that I'm completely incompatible.",
    "svo0111_028": "It's a condition where I'm TOO compatible and end up exhibiting abilities beyond\r\nwhat the devs imagined.",
    "svo0111_029": "Like what?",
    "svo0111_030": "Uh... You know how everything in a VR world is just digital data, right?\r\nLike those trees and that grass.",
    "svo0111_031": "Well, the human eye perceives that data as real trees and grass.",
    "svo0111_032": "This may not be a very nice way of putting it,\r\nbut it's almost like it's tricking your brain.",
    "svo0111_033": "However, Fuuka's condition allows her to see past those deceptions.\r\nShe can perceive these objects as their raw data instead.",
    "svo0111_034": "In-game navigation AI can analyze monster and field data and explain them,\r\nbut...",
    "svo0111_035": "So you can basically do the same thing as them? Even though you're human?",
    "svo0111_036": "Exactly.",
    "svo0111_037": "Wow, that's amazing! It's like you were born with superpowers!",
    "svo0111_038": "I see, so that's how you were able to know Klein's cage was a breakable object\r\nso quickly.",
    "svo0111_039": "I didn't exactly see that. It's something a little more instinctual.",
    "svo0111_040": "And it's honestly more of a curse than a blessing.\r\nIt means I can't really enjoy games.",
    "svo0111_041": "So no matter how beautiful the graphics are, I just perceive them as data.",
    "svo0111_042": "I can't appreciate them like normal players.",
    "svo0111_043": "Fuuka's symptoms are intense and rare, but since there are some people\r\nout there who have trouble converting digital data into sensory data...",
    "svo0111_044": "...Galaxia's devs are using the project as an opportunity to research ways\r\nto help them.",
    "svo0111_045": "Right. I've been involved with the development since the beginning, so we've\r\nbeen together a long time. That's why I'm worried and want to get back soon so\r\nI can find out what's happening.",
    "svo0111_046": "Oh, right, almost forgot.",
    "svo0111_047": "I know I told you there's nothing but meadows up ahead...\r\nBut I actually did spot something curious a little farther out.",
    "svo0111_048": "And what was that?",
    "svo0111_049": "Rrgh... Rgggh... Rgggggh...",
    "svo0111_050": "Wh-What's that sound?",
    "svo0111_051": "A beast, probably. And likely a big one, by the sounds of it.",
    "svo0111_052": "What's the plan, Kiridude?",
    "svo0111_053": "Hmm... Well, as jumbled as it may now be, this is still the world of ALO.\r\nNaturally, there are powerful bosses around.",
    "svo0111_054": "But the stronger they are, the better the reward—Well, usually.\r\nWe could get a new item or even unlock a new path.",
    "svo0111_055": "We should take our time getting ready and—",
    "svo0111_056": "I'm going to kill it. Follow me into battle, all of you.",
    "svo0111_057": "Yeah... I figured you'd say that.",
    "svo0111_058": "Hot damn, now that's a huge Gate.",
    "svo0111_059": "That boss was guarding this, wasn't it? Where do you think it goes?",
    "svo0111_060": "Kirito... Doesn't this remind you of something?",
    "svo0111_061": "Like what?",
    "svo0111_062": "Galaxia.",
    "svo0111_063": "Remember how there was a Gate that led in and out of the recreation of the past?",
    "svo0111_064": "I'm thinking this here's an exit.",
    "svo0111_065": "Wait... so you're saying this area was actually made by Galaxia?",
    "svo0111_066": "And that we've been trapped in it all along?",
    "svo0111_067": "But if this is an exit... Then where does it go?",
    "svo0111_068": "Worrying about that shall not yield any results.\r\nThere is only one way to find out.",
    "svo0111_069": "Point taken.",
    "svo0111_070": "Whoa... What a sight. It's like we're floating in space.",
    "svo0111_071": "But it's totally different from the world of ALO that we know.\r\nHow did this happen?",
    "svo0111_072": "Wait... Do you think those lights are all VR worlds created by Galaxia's system\r\nerror?",
    "svo0111_073": "There's so many of them, big and small...\r\nHow are we supposed to find the Test Room this way?",
    "svo0111_074": "Hey Fuuka, does that \"overfitting\" thing of yours let you see where we're\r\nsupposed to go?",
    "svo0111_075": "Nope. It's not that overpowered.",
    "svo0111_076": "All it can do is let her see objects in front of her in a slightly different\r\nway...",
    "svo0111_077": "Oh, that's too bad.",
    "svo0111_078": "So what're we gonna do, Kiridude? Visit those sparkly things one after another?",
    "svo0111_079": "That would take us a lifetime.",
    "svo0111_080": "I am weary of walking. Could we not perhaps teleport to them directly?",
    "svo0111_081": "Hey, why don't we take little break first, no matter what we decide to do?\r\nSo much has happened that I'm getting a headache...",
    "svo0111_082": "Good idea. Though I don't think a void like this will make a very relaxing rest\r\nstop.",
    "svo0111_083": "Fuuka, careful, you're starting to wander away. Are you all right?",
    "svo0111_084": "I'm fine. I'm fine.\r\nI'm just looking at those VR spaces over there.",
    "svo0111_085": "Hmm, they come in all different sizes. The small ones are about the size of an\r\napartment. Now, where's a nice one... Aha!",
    "svo0111_086": "Hey guys, why don't we take our break in here?\r\nIt's like a fancy little bungalow!",
    "svo0111_087": "A bungalow?",
    "svo0111_088": "Uh, it's a type of building, like a small house you can stay the night in.",
    "svo0111_089": "I'd kill for a place to kick back and relax right about now.\r\nLet's have us a look here... Whoa!",
    "svo0111_090": "Oh my gosh... Ki-Kirito, isn't this...",
    "svo0111_091": "Our log cabin?!",
    "svo0111_092": "Y-You know this building?",
    "svo0111_093": "Yeah, it's where we hang out in ALO. I'd bet my life it's the same place.\r\nGlad to see it's still in one piece...",
    "svo0111_094": "Yeah, thank goodness.",
    "svo0111_095": "Man, there really is no place like home! I mean, not that it is home,\r\nbut close enough.",
    "svo0111_096": "But damn, we're so lucky we spotted it so fast.\r\nIt's like finding a needle in a haystack on the first try!",
    "svo0111_097": "And I'm the one who found that needle!",
    "svo0111_098": "Damn right you did! Thanks, Fuuka!",
    "svo0111_099": "Then let's take a little break in here. We should use this as our base for our\r\nfuture explorations.",
    "svo0111_100": "Amen to that!",
    "svo0111_101": "...",
    "svo0111_102": "(I hope this isn't the case...)",
    "svo0111_103": "(But what if Asuna got caught up in all this and is somewhere in this world?\r\nIf so, it'd be great if we could find her...)",
    "svo0201_001": "The area from here on out is woodlands. From what I could tell, it appears to be\r\nendless forest in every direction.",
    "svo0201_002": "I think—no, I'm absolutely sure—monsters are prowling about too.",
    "svo0201_003": "Considering the size of the map and the predictable risks, perhaps it would be\r\nmore efficient to bring along a slightly larger group.",
    "svo0201_004": "Which is why I propose we pull back for now and make sure we have absolutely\r\neverything we need. What do you think?",
    "svo0201_005": "...Commander?",
    "svo0201_006": "Hmm, a moment, if you would.",
    "svo0201_007": "I understand what you are telling me, but I believe it would be better if we had\r\nat least some idea of the upcoming terrain and monsters beforehand.",
    "svo0201_008": "So would it not be best for us to scout the area ahead before beginning the\r\nexpedition in earnest?\r\n",
    "svo0201_009": "You mean... just us?",
    "svo0201_010": "Oh, do you not agree with that plan?",
    "svo0201_011": "...I can't. Not in good faith, anyway.",
    "svo0201_012": "Not only have we never been to this area before, but the visibility's poor and\r\nthere's only three of us now. I don't see the need to take any unnecessary\r\nrisks.",
    "svo0201_013": "But more importantly, you're an indispensable asset in clearing Aincrad,\r\nso if something were to happen to you...",
    "svo0201_014": "Very prudent. I've been away from combat for a while, so I was hoping to get\r\nback my groove.",
    "svo0201_015": "Besides, being the first to press into uncharted territory is quite the\r\nthrilling experience.",
    "svo0201_016": "You and that Black Swordsman friend of yours aren't the types to leap before you\r\nlook, are you?",
    "svo0201_017": "I guess not... Actually, never mind, I can't say the same for him.",
    "svo0201_018": "Once he sets his mind on something, he never listens to what I have to say!\r\nWhy, just the other day...",
    "svo0201_019": "Uh... Ahem. I don't see what he has to do with any of this.",
    "svo0201_020": "True enough. I beg your pardon.",
    "svo0201_021": "I-It's quite all right... Uh, so, what do you think?",
    "svo0201_021_2": "Nautilus.",
    "svo0201_022": "Me? Well, so long as we bail out at the right time, we should be fine...\r\nI think.",
    "svo0201_023": "I'm not saying we should let our guards down, but I doubt we'll come across a\r\nmonster who can breach the commander's defenses.",
    "svo0201_024": "But...",
    "svo0201_025": "So Nautilus approves of the survey, then.\r\nIf we're going by majority rule, that's two votes to one.",
    "svo0201_026": "Commander!",
    "svo0201_027": "Though I do have some confidence in my abilities,\r\nmore than anything I have faith in the two of you.",
    "svo0201_028": "I don't believe any of us will do anything rash or foolish.\r\nWhat do you say to that, Asuna?",
    "svo0201_029": "...All right. I'll do it.\r\nIf that's what you've decided, then I'll see your orders carried out.",
    "svo0201_030": "But promise me we won't hesitate to turn back if we run into danger.",
    "svo0201_031": "I promise. Shall we, then?",
    "svo0201_032": "Hey, Asuna... Is it just me, or does the commander seem kinda...\r\nI dunno, fired up today?",
    "svo0201_033": "You think so? I guess now that you mention it, it's not like him to be gung-ho\r\nabout exploring with such a small party.",
    "svo0201_034": "(Now that Nautilus put the idea in my head...\r\nThe commander does kinda seem to be enjoying himself.)",
    "svo0201_035": "(...)",
    "svo0201_036": "(Heathcliff, Commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.\r\nNautilus, a fellow member of the guild. And myself... Vice Commander.)",
    "svo0201_037": "(We have been imprisoned in the world of the VR game Sword Art Online by Akihiko\r\nKayaba.)",
    "svo0201_038": "(We have to beat this game in order to escape with our lives.)",
    "svo0201_039": "(At least, that's how it was supposed to be. However...)",
    "svo0201_040": "(I don't know why, but something doesn't feel right.\r\nThis whole thing seems off...)",
    "svo0201_041": "Asuna?",
    "svo0201_042": "It's nothing. Let's get go—",
    "svo0201_043": "Wh-What was that?",
    "svo0201_044": "Damn you... I'll blow you away!",
    "svo0201_045": "Did that come from the forest?",
    "svo0201_046": "Someone must be fighting.",
    "svo0201_047": "Hey, now's not the time to sit back and relax!\r\nWe've got a horde of monsters coming our way!",
    "svo0201_048": "Let's thin their ranks and help that player!",
    "svo0201_049": "There, that should take care of most of the monsters.\r\nI must say, that was rather anticlimactic for my first battle in a while.",
    "svo0201_050": "Yeah, they went down easier than expected.",
    "svo0201_051": "Stay focused. Mind your surroundings.",
    "svo0201_052": "Roger... Wait, someone's coming.",
    "svo0201_053": "Heya! Thanks for distracting those monsters!",
    "svo0201_054": "But boy, was that close! You guys sure are tough.\r\nThey mighta kicked my butt if I were all alone!",
    "svo0201_055": "What about you? Did those monsters give you any trouble?\r\nThey didn't damage you badly or inflict any status effects, did they?",
    "svo0201_056": "Nah, barely a scratch on me!",
    "svo0201_057": "Oh, by the way, I'm Fukaziroh. Thanks for the assist!",
    "svo0202_001": "Glad we made it in time. We're the Knights of the Blood Oath.",
    "svo0202_002": "I'm Asuna, their vice commander. And these two are...",
    "svo0202_003": "Heathcliff. I'm their commander.",
    "svo0202_004": "Umm, and I'm Nautilus. Just another member of the guild.",
    "svo0202_005": "Oh, wow! The Knights of the Blood Oath?! You guys are famous!",
    "svo0202_006": "Hmm... So you believe we really are the Knights of the Blood Oath?\r\nNot impostors?",
    "svo0202_007": "Shouldn't I? I mean, when I say you're famous, I'm talking super famous.\r\nI read about you on the internet and in that book about the SAO Incident.",
    "svo0202_008": "You're that big guild founded in SAO that fought on the frontlines and were\r\ncrucial to clearing Aincrad. But your commander was actually...",
    "svo0202_009": "Huh? If you're Commander Heathcliff, then...",
    "svo0202_010": "Uh...",
    "svo0202_011": "I'm sorry... Is something about me bothering you?",
    "svo0202_012": "This is weird... I'm pretty sure it was a shocking twist...\r\nNgh, now I can't remember what I was gonna say.",
    "svo0202_013": "I see. So this girl's memories and knowledge have been scrambled...\r\nPerhaps \"replaced\" is a better word for it?",
    "svo0202_014": "Commander? Did you say something?",
    "svo0202_015": "No, it's nothing.",
    "svo0202_016": "At any rate, what are you doing here, Fukaziroh?\r\nI seem to recall this area being uncharted.",
    "svo0202_017": "Were you doing some solo grinding?",
    "svo0202_018": "Well see, here's the thing... I don't have a clue.",
    "svo0202_019": "I was just out grinding near town with my friend only a few minutes ago.",
    "svo0202_020": "But then I suddenly found myself all alone in this forest.\r\nAnd to make things worse, I was surrounded by those monsters.",
    "svo0202_021": "You mean you were sent here against your will? Did you bump into a teleportation\r\ntrap, perhaps?",
    "svo0202_022": "That's certainly frightening.\r\nYou could have been killed had the situation been even slightly different.\r\nI'd greatly enjoy hearing further details, but...",
    "svo0202_023": "Monsters! Monsters approaching! At this rate they'll have us surrounded!",
    "svo0202_024": "I suppose we should ensure our safety first.\r\nLet's split into two teams and take them out as we make our escape.",
    "svo0202_025": "Would you lend me your aid, Fukaziroh?",
    "svo0202_026": "You got it, Mr. Commander Guy! I'm your girl!",
    "svo0202_027": "I don't see any monsters behind us. Looks like we were able\r\nto shake them off.",
    "svo0202_028": "Good work. We should be safe now that we've made it this far.\r\nThank you for your assistance, Fukaziroh.",
    "svo0202_029": "Aw, it was nothing! Now, I get to tell people I fought side-by-side with the\r\nKnights of the Blood Oath!",
    "svo0202_030": "I've got to say though, I don't think I've seen anyone here fight with weapons\r\nlike those. I mean... dual-wielding pistols?",
    "svo0202_031": "Oh, you mean Rightony and Leftania? They're not pistols, they're grenade \r\nlaunchers. These cute babies can blow up anything within their range!",
    "svo0202_032": "(Since when did SAO have weapons like those?)",
    "svo0202_033": "Hey, Fukaziroh? Do you remember where you got them?",
    "svo0202_034": "Huh? Hmm... I got them at a shop, I think?",
    "svo0202_035": "Yeah, now it's coming back to me. I went to check out gear with LLENN,\r\nand then this guy at the shop explained them...",
    "svo0202_036": "What shop?",
    "svo0202_037": "Uh... Huh, I don't remember.",
    "svo0202_038": "...",
    "svo0202_039": "Umm, say, Asuna? Maybe ease up on the new person.",
    "svo0202_040": "Besides, you specialize in rapiers, right? Or, are you thinking of switching it up?",
    "svo0202_041": "Well, no, that wasn't what I had in mind... But, I guess you're right.\r\nSorry about that, Fukaziroh.",
    "svo0202_042": "Nah, don't sweat it. But still...",
    "svo0202_043": "Now, it's really bugging me... Gah...",
    "svo0202_044": "(Yes, exactly, what she said. Something doesn't feel right.\r\nLike this is all wrong.)",
    "svo0202_045": "(But I've got no clue why that could be. Agh, it's so frustrating.)",
    "svo0202_046": "Come now, we have no idea if those monsters will respawn.\r\nLet's get out of this forest for now.",
    "svo0202_047": "Roger that.",
    "svo0203_001": "S-So, uh... you're the actual Yuna, right? The AR idol?",
    "svo0203_002": "Yep! That's right!",
    "svo0203_003": "Omigosh... It's her, it's really her...",
    "svo0203_004": "So you know about me, huh? Do you play Ordinal Scale?",
    "svo0203_005": "Are you a fan of my songs?",
    "svo0203_006": "Y-Yeah, of course!",
    "svo0203_007": "M-My favorite is ''Ubiquitous dB''! I must have listened to it hundreds of times!",
    "svo0203_008": "Oh, and I've bought all your singles and albums too!\r\nAnd when I go to karaoke, I always sing your songs!",
    "svo0203_009": "Wow, thanks! I'm glad to hear that!",
    "svo0203_010": "Oh... I never dreamed I'd actually meet Yuna here of all places...",
    "svo0203_011": "U-Umm, can I shake your hand?!",
    "svo0203_012": "Of course! Shake away!",
    "svo0203_013": "Wow, a-amazing, I can really feel your hand! This is a dream come true!",
    "svo0203_014": "...",
    "svo0203_015": "Hey.",
    "svo0203_016": "Y-Yes?!",
    "svo0203_017": "Enough with the yapping. Get moving. If you slow me down,\r\nI'll kill you.",
    "svo0203_018": "Oh, would you like a handshake too, Mr. Death Gun?",
    "svo0203_019": "No.",
    "svo0203_020": "Mmm, I was hoping I could make you a fan of me and my songs, too.",
    "svo0203_021": "Oh, I know! Why don't I sing one now?",
    "svo0203_022": "Don't.",
    "svo0203_023": "Pretty please?",
    "svo0203_024": "No means no. Shut up.",
    "svo0203_025": "What?! Aww, that's such a waste.\r\nWhen else are we ever gonna get a chance like this?",
    "svo0203_026": "I mean, this is Yuna we're talking about here! And she's offering to sing live!\r\nFor us! Right in front of us!",
    "svo0203_027": "I don't give a damn. I've never heard of any Yuna.",
    "svo0203_028": "What?! N-No way! Have you been living under a rock?!",
    "svo0203_029": "Keep talking and I'll bury you under one.",
    "svo0203_030": "Hey, guys.",
    "svo0203_031": "You should really keep it down.\r\nIf there are any monsters nearby, they'll have heard that.",
    "svo0203_032": "...",
    "svo0203_033": "...",
    "svo0203_034": "I'd be lying big time if I said I didn't want to hear you sing live...\r\nMaybe next time.",
    "svo0203_035": "Bummer...",
    "svo0203_036": "Tch. Someone end my misery.\r\nThese girls wouldn't know danger even with a knife to their throat.",
    "svo0203_037": "I don't see the problem.\r\nIt just means they're keeping it together amid all this craziness.",
    "svo0203_038": "Besides, we're supposed to be working together for now.\r\nMeaning we're not going to make things harder for each other.",
    "svo0203_039": "I'm sure you understand that, so don't go making waves.",
    "svo0203_040": "You're all getting on my nerves.",
    "svo0203_041": "Hey, monsters approaching at three o'clock.",
    "svo0203_042": "Look, there's enemies. You wanna complain? Then earn your keep first.",
    "svo0203_043": "Heh, heh. Don't slow me down, got it?",
    "svo0203_044": "Phew. We actually drove them back...",
    "svo0203_045": "Apparently there're still tons of monsters in the area.",
    "svo0203_046": "Maybe we're smack dab in the middle of a horde.\r\nHow about we go back and try to find another route?",
    "svo0203_047": "Hmph. Coward.",
    "svo0203_048": "Hmm?",
    "svo0203_049": "We can kill them. Our path is clear once they're dead.",
    "svo0203_050": "So, all we have to do is keep killing and killing.",
    "svo0203_051": "Kill, kill, kill. Kill, kill, kill.\r\nKill, kill, kill. Kill, kill, kill.",
    "svo0203_052": "Keep killing to clear the way! Isn't it wonderful how that works?!\r\nHah, hahaha!",
    "svo0203_053": "But what's the point of that?",
    "svo0203_054": "What did you say?",
    "svo0203_055": "I don't see what good it would do to wipe out all the monsters if you're not in\r\nit for the EXP or drops. It sounds very inefficient.",
    "svo0203_056": "Yeah, what she said. It'll be a waste of time and effort.\r\nWe should just avoid them like any other player would.",
    "svo0203_057": "Do you still want to kill all the monsters? Why? What do you get out of it?",
    "svo0203_058": "...",
    "svo0203_059": "Come on, tell me.",
    "svo0203_060": "...",
    "svo0203_061": "Well, sounds to me like we're going the pacifist route.\r\nNow that that's settled, let's wait until we see a chance to get away.",
    "svo0203_062": "Sounds good to me.",
    "svo0203_063": "Wait, hold on a sec.",
    "svo0203_064": "What for?",
    "svo0203_065": "The monsters moved.",
    "svo0203_066": "D-Did they spot us?",
    "svo0203_067": "Hmm... I don't think so? Looks to me like they're going after some other prey.",
    "svo0203_068": "You mean a player? What do you make of them?",
    "svo0203_069": "They're moving behind the rocks, so I can't tell from here.",
    "svo0203_070": "Wh-What should we do?",
    "svo0203_071": "If someone's being attacked by monsters, we've gotta help them quick!",
    "svo0204_001": "Hmph. So, the monsters are attacking a player, are they?",
    "svo0204_002": "Damn perfect. If I do say so myself.\r\nLet's take this opportunity to run.",
    "svo0204_003": "Y-You mean we should just abandon them?!",
    "svo0204_004": "Wrong.",
    "svo0204_005": "I'm saying, we should make use of this fool, racing toward their own death.",
    "svo0204_006": "They're an ideal decoy!\r\nHeh, heh, heh.",
    "svo0204_007": "You can't be serious...",
    "svo0204_008": "Mmm...",
    "svo0204_009": "First you want to kill, then you say we should run?\r\nYou really need to get your story straight, Mr. Death Gun.",
    "svo0204_010": "You wanna run that by me again?",
    "svo0204_011": "Are you always so indecisive?",
    "svo0204_012": "That's no way to live. No one ever takes people like that seriously or puts\r\ntheir faith in them. It's such a waste, really.",
    "svo0204_013": "...",
    "svo0204_014": "Hahaha! Someone sure got burned!",
    "svo0204_015": "Anyway, we can't just leave that player to the wolves.\r\nWhaddya say we go save them?",
    "svo0204_016": "Yeah!",
    "svo0204_017": "Good idea. The more, the merrier!",
    "svo0204_018": "Tch...",
    "svo0204_019": "They should be around here...",
    "svo0204_020": "Who's there?!",
    "svo0204_021": "...!",
    "svo0204_022": "Are you the one being chased by monsters? Where are you?",
    "svo0204_023": "Do you need some help?",
    "svo0204_024": "Yes, please, help me. I'm hiding in the crack of a large rock behind you.",
    "svo0204_025": "But I can't get out. Not while I'm surrounded.",
    "svo0204_026": "So we just need to send 'em packing, eh? You got it!",
    "svo0204_027": "Wait, please!",
    "svo0204_028": "Hmph. So, we killed them all after all.",
    "svo0204_029": "The coast is clear now.",
    "svo0204_030": "Oh, thank you. I'll be right there.",
    "svo0204_031": "But I need you to promise me something first.\r\nI swear I'm not your enemy, so please don't attack me.",
    "svo0204_032": "Huh? Well sure, I mean, why would we?",
    "svo0204_033": "...",
    "svo0204_034": "Huh?",
    "svo0204_035": "What?",
    "svo0204_036": "The hell?",
    "svo0204_037": "A spider?!",
    "svo0204_038": "Calm yourselves. I am not a monster, and I mean you no harm.",
    "svo0204_039": "Are you an NPC, then? Did we trip some kind of event flag or something?",
    "svo0204_040": "You are not too far from the truth, in a sense...\r\nBut I am not part of some pre-planned event.",
    "svo0204_041": "My name is Charlotte. And I ask that you take what's on my back.",
    "svo0204_042": "What is that?",
    "svo0204_043": "A radio. The kind used in Gun Gale Online.",
    "svo0204_044": "I want you to use this to speak to my master.",
    "svo0204_045": "Your master?",
    "svo0204_046": "Ooh, lemme do it! Hello, can you hear me?!",
    "svo0204_047": "You needn't speak so loud. I can hear you just fine.",
    "svo0204_048": "First, I must thank you for saving my familiar, Charlotte.",
    "svo0204_049": "Now then... I'll get straight to the point. I need your help.",
    "svo0205_001": "How long has it been since I was sent to this strange world?",
    "svo0205_002": "No, not \"sent.\" Maybe it's more accurate to say \"woke up in.\"",
    "svo0205_003": "I must be in some sort of VR world. Being in my avatar makes that pretty clear.",
    "svo0205_004": "All I can see around me is some dreary, otherworldly town. However, the size of\r\nthe structures and their layout is similar to The Real World.",
    "svo0205_005": "It's almost like someone pasted textures from another world onto a modern\r\nJapanese city. How utterly bizarre...",
    "svo0205_006": "Chaotic is the first word that springs to mind.\r\nBut if there's one thing I can say for sure...",
    "svo0205_007": "...It's that everything in this world is wrong.",
    "svo0205_008": "Yes, that's right! Everything I see is disgusting and revolting!\r\nI can't stand it!",
    "svo0205_009": "I am an emperor! I am a god!",
    "svo0205_010": "The world must be ruled and governed by me!\r\nThat is the way it is supposed to be!",
    "svo0205_011": "And yet–",
    "svo0205_012": "What are you grumbling over, Oberon? You're falling behind. Keep up.",
    "svo0205_013": "Hurry up or we'll leave you.",
    "svo0205_014": "We won't be able to help you against any monsters if you get separated.\r\nKeep up the pace!",
    "svo0205_015": "Oh hey, I know! If you're tired of walking, why don't you scout ahead for us?",
    "svo0205_016": "After all, you and I are the only ones who can fly,\r\nand I covered recon last time.",
    "svo0205_017": "I am the Fairy King... Not some errand boy...",
    "svo0205_018": "A king should be industrious if he intends to stand above others, should he not?",
    "svo0205_019": "They say incompetent leaders get a bullet in the back.",
    "svo0205_020": "Just find the top of some random building and take a look around.",
    "svo0205_021": "Umm... You can handle that much even if you're not used to exploring, right?\r\nOh, but if that's too hard, I can give you an easier—",
    "svo0205_022": "A-Are you mocking me?!\r\nI could do so with the slightest effort if I pleased!",
    "svo0205_023": "Then why not stop wasting time complaining and do it?",
    "svo0205_024": "Urk...\r\nF-Fine. I'll be back!",
    "svo0205_025": "There appears to be a large horde of monsters ahead.",
    "svo0205_026": "This world seems to feature a great many enemies.\r\nI'll have to put those fightmongers to good use.",
    "svo0205_027": "I have the little puppets by the strings, working hard to keep me safe!",
    "svo0205_028": "How foolish they are thinking that they are the ones using me!\r\nThis little recon was all part of my master plan.",
    "svo0205_029": "Hee hee hee hee!\r\nMwah ha ha ha ha ha!",
    "svo0205_030": "...",
    "svo0205_031": "Perhaps, I should head back.",
    "svo0205_032": "I see...\r\nSo there's a monster horde approaching.",
    "svo0205_033": "What should we do? It doesn't sound like that many to me.\r\nI think we could take 'em.",
    "svo0205_034": "We haven't looked deeper inside yet.\r\nThere could be something in here. Maybe players like us.",
    "svo0205_035": "You have a point. Let's fight our way through, then.",
    "svo0205_036": "I like the sound of that!",
    "svo0205_037": "No objections here.",
    "svo0205_038": "Hmph. Very well. I'll leave it to you, then.",
    "svo0205_039": "Nonsense. You're going to fight too.",
    "svo0205_040": "Excuse me?",
    "svo0205_041": "There's no way we're gonna let someone who can fly do nothing.\r\nYou'll be storming the front with Yuuki.",
    "svo0205_042": "Break a leg!",
    "svo0205_043": "W-Wait, I...",
    "svo0205_044": "*huffing*",
    "svo0205_045": "Quit the theatrics. You're in an avatar.\r\nIt's not like you're actually tired.",
    "svo0205_046": "This is mental fatigue. Th-This is preposterous!\r\nI refuse to stoop so low as to perform physical labor for these fools!",
    "svo0205_047": "I don't see anyone around. With so many buildings for cover,\r\nthis is an ideal location to set up a base.",
    "svo0205_048": "Hey, guys! Come here! I found something!",
    "svo0205_049": "What is this?",
    "svo0205_050": "Dead players.\r\nSee how they're labeled \"DEAD\"?",
    "svo0205_051": "They're dead?! People can die in this world?!",
    "svo0205_052": "When an avatar dies here, wh-what happens to the player's consciousness?",
    "svo0205_053": "Beats me. I don't know how this world's rules work.",
    "svo0205_054": "But an avatar's form lingering like this isn't normal.",
    "svo0205_055": "In ALO and GGO, you'd just respawn. Even newbies know that.\r\nI wonder if this is like the BoB tournament.",
    "svo0205_056": "You can still see their wounds.\r\nThis isn't normal.",
    "svo0205_057": "Since the avatars are still intact, there might be a way to revive them.",
    "svo0205_058": "I doubt it'll be as easy as paying the respawn cost, though.",
    "svo0205_059": "But this many people—or players, as you call them—",
    "svo0205_060": "What could have killed so many players in one go?\r\nSeems like they were attacked by something really powerful.",
    "svo0205_061": "Hmm. Maybe, but something feels off. Look at the wounds.",
    "svo0205_062": "Some have cuts from a blade. I think this other player was shot.\r\nAny way you slice it, monsters didn't do this.",
    "svo0205_063": "These aren't giant boss-monster-size wounds either.\r\nThese are from human-size weapons.",
    "svo0205_064": "Meaning they were killed by player weapons?\r\nCould it have been friendly fire?",
    "svo0205_065": "Don't you gamers love your \"PvPs\" and your \"PKs\" and your \"GGs\"?!",
    "svo0205_066": "Those are all completely different things.",
    "svo0205_067": "In any case, we can't trust any of the players here!",
    "svo0205_068": "D-Don't tell me you were scheming too!\r\nPlanning to lop off my head in my sleep, were you?!",
    "svo0205_069": "If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't wait for you to take a nap.\r\nI'd end you here and now.",
    "svo0205_070": "Tell me, pitiful man, what worth does your head even have?",
    "svo0205_071": "...",
    "svo0205_072": "That shut him up.",
    "svo0205_073": "Well, there are some hot-blooded players, that's for sure.",
    "svo0205_074": "But I don't think they'd have a reason to go at each other like this.\r\nEspecially, not at this scale.",
    "svo0205_075": "I agree with you, but what could this be then?",
    "svo0205_076": "Suppose they did have a reason to turn on each other...\r\nWhat do you think it could have been?",
    "svo0205_077": "Hmmm. That's a toughie. Maybe something threw them into a mass panic?\r\nIt's a long shot, but I'm not sure what else it could be.",
    "svo0205_078": "We can't exclude the possibility that some massive force attacked them\r\nwith swords and firearms either.",
    "svo0205_079": "I guess it's still too soon to say.",
    "svo0205_080": "In any case, we need more information.\r\nWe should start by looking for survivors.",
    "svo0205_081": "Unfortunately, there are no surviving players here.",
    "svo0205_082": "However, if it is information you seek, I may be able to assist.",
    "svo0205_083": "Who is that?!",
    "svo0205_084": "*screech*\r\nA sp-spider?!",
    "svo0205_085": "A monster?",
    "svo0205_086": "That I am, but a foe I am not.\r\nThat our paths have crossed is a blessing, Alice.",
    "svo0205_087": "Do you know me?",
    "svo0205_088": "I know of you, though we haven't spoken previously.",
    "svo0205_089": "I am Charlotte. I am gathering allies at the behest of my master.",
    "svo0205_090": "And which master would that be?",
    "svo0205_091": "Lady Cardinal.",
    "svo0205_092": "You work for Cardinal?!\r\nThat's not possible!",
    "svo0205_093": "If you're interested, why don't you join me?",
    "svo0206_001": "A-Are you going to go with her?\r\nCould it be some kind of trap?",
    "svo0206_002": "If this is truly an invitation from Lady Cardinal herself,\r\nI see no danger in accompanying her.",
    "svo0206_003": "Do you know this Cardinal person?",
    "svo0206_004": "She was a great sage in Underworld, where I am from.\r\nShe has saved Kirito and I on multiple occasions. I owe her a great deal.",
    "svo0206_005": "Kirito?!",
    "svo0206_006": "What is it, Oberon?",
    "svo0206_007": "Do you know Kirito?",
    "svo0206_008": "C-Can't say that I do.\r\nI wouldn't want to remember him if I did.",
    "svo0206_009": "(So he does.)",
    "svo0206_010": "However, there is one problem.\r\nI'm certain Lady Cardinal has already passed.",
    "svo0206_011": "See? It's a trap!\r\nWe should stay far, far away!",
    "svo0206_012": "Hmm.",
    "svo0206_013": "Well...",
    "svo0206_014": "I can't say for certain, but I think that maybe in this place...",
    "svo0206_015": "Hm?",
    "svo0206_016": "...",
    "svo0206_017": "I'm just saying that the impossible could be possible.\r\nThat somebody who couldn't be here maybe is. Just, maybe.",
    "svo0206_018": "Don't think about what we should do. Rather, what do you want to do, Alice?",
    "svo0206_019": "If Lady Cardinal is indeed alive, I would like to meet with her.",
    "svo0206_020": "That's settled then! If it does end up being a trap,\r\nwe can always cross that bridge when we come to it!",
    "svo0206_021": "Indeed.",
    "svo0206_022": "Charlotte, was it? Will you guide us?",
    "svo0206_023": "Of course. Come with me.",
    "svo0206_024": "I will warn you, however, this area is teeming with beasts.\r\nBe prepared for a fight.",
    "svo0206_025": "Meaning you need us as much as we need you. I'm in!",
    "svo0206_026": "Me too.",
    "svo0206_027": "Thank you both.",
    "svo0206_028": "D-Don't forget about me.",
    "svo0206_029": "This is my choice. I've no intention to force you to come with us.\r\nWould you prefer to stay here?",
    "svo0206_030": "Urk! S-Solitude isn't befitting of a king.\r\nI will accompany you.",
    "svo0206_031": "Here we are.\r\nLady Cardinal is inside.",
    "svo0206_032": "Listen to what she has to say.\r\nThen decide whether to help her or to leave.",
    "svo0206_033": "Several others came to see her before you. One word of warning. Absolutely do not\r\nbicker in her presence. The Lady doesn't take kindly to squabbling.",
    "svo0206_034": "You heard the spider, Oberon.",
    "svo0206_035": "Why am I being singled out here?",
    "svo0206_036": "I just get the feeling you might be quick to come to odds with her.",
    "svo0206_037": "Look, someone's coming.",
    "svo0206_038": "Ah! Alice! Sinon!",
    "svo0206_039": "Silica! And Agil, too!",
    "svo0206_040": "So you were dragged into this as well.",
    "svo0206_041": "Seems so. It's good to lay eyes on you.",
    "svo0206_042": "If I remember right, you were...",
    "svo0206_043": "Yuuki?!",
    "svo0206_044": "You're Asuna's friends, right? It's been a long time!",
    "svo0206_045": "Y-Yeah.\r\nIt's been a while.",
    "svo0206_046": "Well, this is a surprise.",
    "svo0206_047": "Well, yeah, I guess that's how it goes sometimes.",
    "svo0206_048": "No use worrying about the details when you can't even tell up from down.",
    "svo0206_049": "More of you? I'm sick of all this noise.",
    "svo0206_050": "!",
    "svo0206_051": "You're Sterben! No—Death Gun!",
    "svo0206_052": "Mm?",
    "svo0206_053": "...",
    "svo0206_054": "Heh heh. I thought I recognized you. You're the one Kyoji was obsessed with.\r\nSinon, was it?",
    "svo0206_055": "Wh-What are you doing here?",
    "svo0206_056": "Does it matter? I have no interest in you.",
    "svo0206_057": "Maybe you don't care, but I do! What the hell are you planning this time?!",
    "svo0206_058": "That's how you feel?",
    "svo0206_059": "What will you do? What can you do about anything?",
    "svo0206_060": "Silica, Agil, get away from him! He's—",
    "svo0206_061": "Silence!",
    "svo0206_062": "!",
    "svo0206_063": "!",
    "svo0206_064": "I've had enough.\r\nDid Charlotte not tell you there was to be no squabbling?",
    "svo0206_065": "This is not the time to settle your personal vendettas!\r\nThere are more important matters at hand!",
    "svo0206_066": "Cardinal! Lady Cardinal!",
    "svo0206_067": "Ah, Alice Synthesis Thirty.\r\nYour countenance has softened considerably since last I saw you.",
    "svo0206_068": "That voice. That form. But...\r\nY-You–",
    "svo0206_069": "How can this be? Are you truly Lady Cardinal?",
    "svo0206_070": "I'm glad to see you are in sound health.\r\nThere was merit in healing the hole in your heart, I see.",
    "svo0206_071": "!",
    "svo0206_072": "Now, while I don't expect that single recollection to be sufficient proof of my\r\nidentity, you have little choice but to believe me.",
    "svo0206_073": "It is only natural to be confused. I am still baffled myself.",
    "svo0206_074": "This little imp, a great sage? You cannot be serious!",
    "svo0206_075": "That I am. Despite my appearance, I am your elder by a great many years.",
    "svo0206_076": "Though I am not currently at my normal strength. Since this place is separate\r\nfrom Underworld, I am not able to do much here.",
    "svo0206_077": "Alice. I owe you an apology for my long absence.\r\nBut let us put that aside for the time being.",
    "svo0206_078": "I imagine you all have your doubts, and some of you are fated to be enemies.",
    "svo0206_079": "But even so, I ask that you set those things aside and listen to what I have to\r\nsay. I trust I have made it clear that this is no time for quarreling. Yes?",
    "svo0207_001": "Now that I have your attention, allow me to reintroduce myself.\r\nI am Cardinal, an inhabitant of the world you call Underworld.",
    "svo0207_002": "I knew there was something suspicious about that name.\r\nIt's the same as that system Kayaba created!",
    "svo0207_003": "In a sense, that is exactly what I am.",
    "svo0207_004": "What?",
    "svo0207_005": "I am a copy of the Cardinal System that controls Underworld.",
    "svo0207_006": "Do you mean to say that you're an autonomous avatar of the system?!\r\nIs that even possible?!",
    "svo0207_007": "I am here precisely because it is.",
    "svo0207_008": "Though that interpretation is not entirely accurate.\r\nAlas, there is no time to explain. May I continue?",
    "svo0207_009": "W-Wait, I want to–",
    "svo0207_010": "First, I must confirm something with you. There is something amiss in this place.\r\nSomething even Real Worlders like yourselves can sense.",
    "svo0207_011": "Would you all agree with that assessment?",
    "svo0207_012": "Amiss? You mean like there's something wrong with the VR world?",
    "svo0207_013": "We spent some time wandering around this GGO-like world,\r\nbut the scenery totally changed once we got here.",
    "svo0207_014": "Plus, there are people here who don't belong.",
    "svo0207_015": "Indeed. I myself am one of them.",
    "svo0207_016": "Even I cannot explain what has happened.",
    "svo0207_017": "Just when I thought I had reached the end of my life,\r\nI woke up in this world along with Charlotte. That is all I know.",
    "svo0207_018": "Allow me to ask you, Alice. Quite some time has passed since we last parted,\r\nhas it not?",
    "svo0207_019": "Yes.",
    "svo0207_020": "As I said, the last thing I remember is that moment in the Central Cathedral.",
    "svo0207_021": "Subjectively speaking, I believe we can say I was transported here immediately\r\nafter that event.",
    "svo0207_022": "The same goes for myself.",
    "svo0207_023": "Indeed. From this, we can form a hypothesis.",
    "svo0207_024": "Charlotte and I, as well as any \"outsiders\" who may be among you,\r\nmay have been summoned.",
    "svo0207_025": "Each from their various spacetimes...",
    "svo0207_026": "To this place, the spacetime in which Alice and you Real Worlders reside.",
    "svo0207_027": "Is that even possible?",
    "svo0207_028": "N-No! That's utter fantasy!",
    "svo0207_029": "I concede that not even I know of a spell that can accomplish this.",
    "svo0207_030": "However, such a thing may exist in some space or some time.",
    "svo0207_031": "If the technology to cross space and time indeed exists,\r\nthere is no need for it to have come from our own.",
    "svo0207_032": "That is what I think, at least.",
    "svo0207_033": "Th-That's pretty confusing.",
    "svo0207_034": "Yeah, I didn't get a word of that.",
    "svo0207_035": "I see what you're saying.\r\nBut that's an unlikely story.",
    "svo0207_036": "As I said, it is merely a theory. I have no proof as it stands.\r\nYet.",
    "svo0207_037": "This is simply the most logical interpretation of the situation based on my\r\ncurrent knowledge and the memories available to me.",
    "svo0207_038": "Hmph. Fine.\r\nI'll go along with your little \"theory.\"",
    "svo0207_039": "If the players were brought here from another spacetime, it's possible the\r\nfields and monsters that make up this world were brought here in the same way.",
    "svo0207_040": "That supposition lends a simple explanation to the chaotic nature of this place.",
    "svo0207_041": "In theory, it is quite unlikely that the residual data from each VR world would\r\nmerge like this.",
    "svo0207_042": "Uh, so basically... the VR world we knew didn't break...",
    "svo0207_043": "...but this happened because a bunch of different VR spaces got all jumbled up\r\nand sent to a different VR space and time somewhere?",
    "svo0207_044": "That's right. Let us assume that is indeed what occurred.",
    "svo0207_045": "Okay, but then...",
    "svo0207_046": "What about what caused it? Who did it? How do we get back?",
    "svo0207_047": "Do you have any of those answers?",
    "svo0207_048": "That is what we need to consider next.\r\nHowever, we lack the data we would need to make a sound hypothesis.",
    "svo0207_049": "Oh...",
    "svo0207_050": "In other words, I'd like to gather more information.",
    "svo0207_051": "Of course, I've done what I could on my own. I started by locating the\r\nSystem Console and establishing this base of operations.",
    "svo0207_052": "The console is barely functional due to system instability,\r\nbut finding it is, at least, a step in the right direction.",
    "svo0207_053": "I have already assembled several other allies in addition to all of you.",
    "svo0207_054": "However, I continue to be short-handed.\r\nIn particular, I require enough military might to search the world unimpeded.",
    "svo0207_055": "This is why I have gathered you here.",
    "svo0207_056": "Heh heh heh.",
    "svo0207_057": "So you want to use us to do what you can't.\r\nIs that right?",
    "svo0207_058": "I'm out. Following your orders. Grouping up with you people.\r\nIt doesn't suit me.",
    "svo0207_059": "I have no reason to stay with you.",
    "svo0207_060": "That's not a nice thing to say, Mr. Death Gun!\r\nWe were getting along so well before!",
    "svo0207_061": "No, we weren't. Be quiet.",
    "svo0207_062": "There is merit in it for you as well.",
    "svo0207_063": "Firstly, as you know, monsters are rampant in this world.\r\nThe more of you cooperating, the safer it will be for everyone.",
    "svo0207_064": "Secondly, according to what information I have been able to gather thus far,\r\nthis world is increasingly unstable.",
    "svo0207_065": "Unstable?",
    "svo0207_066": "I am not simply speaking of visual corruptions. The very fabric of this reality\r\nis unstable, meaning all of our existences themselves are as well.",
    "svo0207_067": "To put it plainly, we are at risk of losing our \"selves.\"",
    "svo0207_068": "Our \"selves\"?",
    "svo0207_069": "A great number of humans have been pulled into this world. And among them,\r\nwe have observed cases of scrambled cognition and lost memories.",
    "svo0207_070": "For example, being unable to understand what is happening or exhibiting\r\nunnatural fear, rage, or other excessive emotional reactions.",
    "svo0207_071": "They may also find themselves stuck reliving past memories.",
    "svo0207_072": "It seems to often be triggered by the strong will or drive of others.\r\nI suppose you could consider it an infection of the consciousness.",
    "svo0207_073": "However, if you were to take that into account and travel in a large group—",
    "svo0207_074": "If an error shows up in one person's consciousness,\r\nthe others could notice and fix it.",
    "svo0207_075": "Precisely. It is for this reason you should avoid working in small groups.",
    "svo0207_076": "Mind you, this is merely a request.\r\nI've no intention of forcing you to cooperate against your will.",
    "svo0207_077": "...",
    "svo0207_078": "Of course, I would appreciate your assistance should you decide to lend it.",
    "svo0207_079": "My first request for those who are willing is a simple one.",
    "svo0207_080": "There is a powerful monster nearby which I would like you to defeat for me.",
    "svo0207_081": "All that girl has done is pass her chores off on us.\r\nWe're being used.",
    "svo0207_082": "I will not abide insults against Lady Cardinal.\r\nMy debt to her is one that can never be repaid.",
    "svo0207_083": "I owe her nothing.\r\nIt has nothing to do with me.",
    "svo0207_084": "Well, staying in a group is definitely a good idea.\r\nEspecially if it's as dangerous as Cardinal said.",
    "svo0207_085": "Agil's right. Isn't that why you stayed with us, Mr. Death Gun?",
    "svo0207_086": "...",
    "svo0207_087": "At any rate, we need a leader.\r\nNo one will benefit if everyone just goes off and does their own thing.",
    "svo0207_088": "Cardinal does the planning and we do the physical stuff.\r\nIt just makes sense.",
    "svo0207_089": "I love big groups, no problem there!",
    "svo0207_090": "Hmph.",
    "svo0207_091": "So, uh, our objective is to defeat the boss monster nearby, right?",
    "svo0207_092": "Yes. This world is split into various zones,\r\neach with powerful monsters deployed at key points.",
    "svo0207_093": "Cardinal believes that by eliminating it,\r\nyou may be able to move into other zones.",
    "svo0207_094": "The first step to gathering the data you need will be to expand the area\r\navailable to you.",
    "svo0207_095": "That's no different from a VR game.",
    "svo0207_096": "That's the thing we have to fight over there.",
    "svo0207_097": "Uh-oh... It's... pretty big. And strong-looking...",
    "svo0207_098": "You needn't hesitate.\r\nWith all of us working together, I've no doubt we will be victorious.",
    "svo0207_099": "Let us begin. All forces, to battle!",
    "svo0207_100": "Um, I think we can go to another area through this gate-thing.\r\nWhat should we do?",
    "svo0207_101": "Let us go as far as we can. Stay vigilant.",
    "svo0207_102": "What... is this place?",
    "svo0207_103": "I see. So this is this world's true form.\r\nAn abnormal transformation indeed.",
    "svo0207_104": "There's another big gate here.",
    "svo0207_105": "Maybe passing through it will bring us to a different world?",
    "svo0207_106": "Let us see.",
    "svo0207_107": "Aincrad...",
    "svo0207_108": "SAO...",
    "svo0207_109": "Aincrad reappeared in ALO too. It could be either one.\r\nEither way, this place is a mess. It's all jumbled up.",
    "svo0207_110": "Cardinal's theory is making more and more sense. What do you think?",
    "svo0207_111": "You really think the field, the monsters, and us,\r\nall came from another spacetime? Bullshit.",
    "svo0207_112": "I dunno, I think it's kind of cool.\r\nNever mind the logic, the reality is that we all exist right here right now.",
    "svo0207_113": "And since this phenomenon brought us all here,\r\nwe should at least make the most of it and have a good time!",
    "svo0207_114": "As this so-called Cardinal said, it's all still hypothetical.\r\nI see no point in such desperate denials.",
    "svo0207_115": "If the truth is something different, the proof will surface in time.\r\nWe need only adjust our reasoning according to the data we find.",
    "svo0207_116": "A theory is only one interpretation. No more than baseline.\r\nStill, there is no reason to ignore it completely.",
    "svo0207_117": "I see. So you are capable of reason. This may actually be the first thing\r\nI can agree with that has left your mouth since we met.",
    "svo0207_118": "I-I find your opinion of me to be far lower than I deserve!",
    "svo0207_119": "Good work. Let's stop here and report back to Cardinal for further orders.",
    "svo0207_120": "I expect she will ask you to continue exploring the world,\r\nbut in any case this is a better opportunity than ever for a short break.",
    "svo0207_121": "SAO? I wonder if a huge number of players will be trapped like back then.",
    "svo0207_122": "...",
    "svo0207_123": "Yuna? What's the matter?",
    "svo0207_124": "Oh, it's nothing.",
    "svo0207_125": "(SAO and Aincrad... In a way, that's where I was born.)",
    "svo0207_126": "(Could Eiji be here too?)",
    "svo0301_001": "It's a desert area. Must be GGO.",
    "svo0301_002": "So changing areas means going to a whole different world.\r\nMan, my brain can't keep up with this!",
    "svo0301_003": "Kirito, do you know what part of GGO this is?",
    "svo0301_004": "No. I'm not actually that experienced with GGO.",
    "svo0301_005": "Besides, the map might not be reproduced properly.\r\nIt'd be better if we assume our knowledge of the geography won't help us.",
    "svo0301_006": "There is one thing that unsettles me.",
    "svo0301_007": "What's that?",
    "svo0301_008": "The Test Room we seek also exists in the world called ALO, yes?",
    "svo0301_009": "Can we still trust that it is here?",
    "svo0301_010": "So many worlds have collided, and they are in such a distorted state.",
    "svo0301_011": "Is it not possible that the entrance to the Test Room manifested not in ALO,\r\nbut in some other world?",
    "svo0301_012": "It's hard to be sure. To be honest, I never expected the worlds to be so\r\nscrambled.",
    "svo0301_013": "Are you able to cast a spell to teleport to our destination?",
    "svo0301_014": "Normally, I would be.",
    "svo0301_015": "I have access permissions for the System Console,\r\nso if we use the teleport command...",
    "svo0301_016": "But you can't right now, is that what you're saying?",
    "svo0301_017": "Correct. I located it before I met with all of you.\r\nFuuka and I tried to use it, but to no avail.",
    "svo0301_018": "Access was denied due to system instability.\r\nFuuka said she couldn't access it either.",
    "svo0301_019": "So our only choice is to walk around on our own feet until we find the\r\nTest Room.",
    "svo0301_020": "I'm sorry.",
    "svo0301_021": "You don't have anything to apologize for.\r\nThis isn't your fault or your responsibility.",
    "svo0301_022": "I anticipated this much, at least.",
    "svo0301_023": "Well, it's not every day you get to experience this kind of chaos!\r\nThis is gonna be a blast!",
    "svo0301_024": "How those words must ring true to such a simple man.\r\nBut you're not altogether mistaken.",
    "svo0301_025": "Glad to hear you're on my side here, Quinella!",
    "svo0301_026": "This is going to be quite interesting. On that point I agree.\r\nSo the technology on this side isn't as perfect as I had thought.",
    "svo0301_027": "It's not just a problem of technology. It just developed differently.\r\nThis world is still being operated by humans.",
    "svo0301_028": "As long as humans are in control, mistakes will be made.\r\nThat applies on this side just as much as it does out there.",
    "svo0301_029": "Not that that tells us what caused all this.",
    "svo0301_030": "What do you mean by \"on this side\" and \"out there\"?",
    "svo0301_031": "Oh, well...",
    "svo0301_032": "Oh, by the way, Neige, is the door to the Test Room something we'll be able\r\nto recognize when we see it?",
    "svo0301_033": "It's hidden from general users, but a marker should appear\r\nif someone involved with development gets close.",
    "svo0301_034": "I think it will be visible to you as long as you're with me or Fuuka.",
    "svo0301_035": "Good. It would be bad if it were right next to us and we couldn't tell.",
    "svo0301_036": "Speaking of Fuuka, where'd she go?\r\nI haven't seen her in a while.",
    "svo0301_037": "She went on patrol not long ago. She said she wanted to do something useful\r\nsince she was making us fight so much.",
    "svo0301_038": "Whoa there, you let her go off on her own? What if a monster shows up?\r\nShe doesn't exactly have the best build for battle.",
    "svo0301_039": "I was worried about that too.",
    "svo0301_040": "But she insisted she'd be fine.\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll run away before they get me!\" she said.",
    "svo0301_041": "Maybe I should have gone with her.",
    "svo0301_042": "Fuuka can be a little headstrong. Sorry.",
    "svo0301_043": "She never listens no matter what I say.\r\nIt does seem like a fun way to live, though.",
    "svo0301_044": "There's only one path. I'm sure we'll run into her if we keep going.",
    "svo0301_045": "Although, we might want to start looking for her if she doesn't come back soon.",
    "svo0301_046": "Ah!",
    "svo0301_047": "What is it?",
    "svo0301_048": "I sense a battle taking place not far ahead.\r\nYou don't think...?",
    "svo0301_049": "Let's check it out.",
    "svo0301_050": "Well, it's not Fuuka. Just monsters. And a few players, it looks like.",
    "svo0301_051": "It looks like they're having a quarrel.",
    "svo0301_052": "Should we help?",
    "svo0301_053": "They look pretty evenly matched. I'd say we should get in there and—Huh?",
    "svo0301_054": "What is it?",
    "svo0301_055": "The one throwing around the mace there looks familiar.",
    "svo0301_056": "Is that...",
    "svo0301_056_2": "Liz?!",
    "svo0301_057": "And the one running around could be... Argo, maybe?\r\nLooks like we've found some of our friends, hey, Kiridude?",
    "svo0301_058": "...",
    "svo0301_059": "You okay, Kirito? You look like you've seen a ghost.",
    "svo0301_060": "It can't be.\r\nHe's...",
    "svo0301_061": "Ah, that boy. What will you do?",
    "svo0301_062": "I'm gonna help them, of course!\r\nGive me a hand, everyone!",
    "svo0301_063": "Sure thing!",
    "svo0301_064": "Let's do it!",
    "svo0301_065": "That takes care of it!",
    "svo0301_066": "Phew! Glad that's over! Thanks for the help!",
    "svo0301_067": "You really saved our butts there.\r\nSo you guys got dragged into this mess too, huh?",
    "svo0301_068": "Glad to see some familiar faces!",
    "svo0301_069": "I feel that. It's a good thing we ran into each other!",
    "svo0301_070": "Oh, you all know each other?",
    "svo0301_071": "You always show up just when you're needed, don't you?\r\nI had a feeling we'd meet.",
    "svo0301_072": "...",
    "svo0301_073": "I don't recognize that look though.\r\nDid you change your outfit?",
    "svo0301_074": "...",
    "svo0301_075": "What's wrong?",
    "svo0301_076": "Nothing. I don't know what to say, is all.",
    "svo0301_077": "Don't force yourself.\r\nI'm sure this world has put you through a lot.",
    "svo0301_078": "You have no idea.",
    "svo0301_079": "(That's right.\r\nIf Administrator exists here, it makes sense that Eugeo would too.)",
    "svo0301_080": "(But what do I say to him?)",
    "svo0301_081": "You're acting strange, Kirito.\r\nAre you hurt?",
    "svo0301_082": "No... I'm fine.\r\nReally, it's nothing.",
    "svo0301_083": "It's good to see you again, Eugeo.",
    "svo0301_084": "Yeah, same for me—",
    "svo0301_085": "!",
    "svo0301_086": "Why do you look so shocked, boy?",
    "svo0301_087": "Administrator!",
    "svo0301_088": "What is it Eugeo? Didn't she just help us?",
    "svo0301_089": "It seems this boy has no sense of gratitude.\r\nWhat to do?",
    "svo0301_090": "I...\r\nYou and I...!",
    "svo0301_091": "What is it? What's going on?",
    "svo0301_092": "Eugeo?",
    "svo0301_093": "You gonna fight her?",
    "svo0301_094": "Calm down, Eugeo.",
    "svo0301_095": "Kirito? What's going on?\r\nWhy is she with you?!",
    "svo0301_096": "What is she doing here?!",
    "svo0301_097": "I'll tell you, but first I need to know...\r\nHow far back do you remember?",
    "svo0301_098": "If you recognize Administrator, that must mean you've met her before.\r\nRight?",
    "svo0301_099": "I... don't know.",
    "svo0301_100": "I know her face. But when I try to remember more than that.\r\nIt's like the memories are fuzzy.",
    "svo0301_101": "Okay. I hear you.",
    "svo0301_102": "I get that you have complicated feelings about the Administrator, believe me.\r\nBut can I ask you just for now to put them aside?",
    "svo0301_103": "Right now, she's on our side to figure out what happened to this messed up\r\nworld.",
    "svo0301_104": "So please, stand down.\r\nAt the least, fighting her shouldn't be your priority right now.",
    "svo0301_105": "...",
    "svo0301_106": "If it were anybody else...\r\nBut for you, Kirito, I'll do it.",
    "svo0301_107": "Thanks, Eugeo.\r\nCan I trust that you'll put this aside for now, too?",
    "svo0301_108": "Haven't I been trying to solve this amicably all along?\r\nI've no reason to fight him.",
    "svo0301_109": "Good. Well, since this is the first time meeting for some of us,\r\nwhy don't we start with self-introductions?",
    "svo0301_110": "A swordsman named Kirito?\r\nWhy do I feel like I've heard of someone like that before?",
    "svo0301_111": "Oh!\r\nAre you the Kirito who won BoB?!",
    "svo0301_112": "But wait, that Kirito had a type-F avatar!\r\nWasn't she a girl?",
    "svo0301_113": "Well, uh, let's take a raincheck on that conversation.",
    "svo0301_114": "LLENN, was it? So you came from GGO, then?",
    "svo0301_115": "Yeah. I don't know if I'd say I \"came\" here as much as I noticed something weird\r\ngoing on with GGO and sort of... wound up here.",
    "svo0301_116": "You guys saw some maps that looked like ALO before you came here, right?\r\nDoes that mean that a whole bunch of VR worlds are connected?",
    "svo0301_117": "What the heck is goin' on around here? I've got no idea what's what!",
    "svo0301_118": "Oh?\r\nThat's not something an information broker worth her salt should be saying.",
    "svo0301_119": "Believe me, I'm not happy about the state of my services right now.\r\nBusiness isn't exactly boomin'.",
    "svo0301_120": "I get it.",
    "svo0301_121": "We're looking for that Test Room because we've been asked to, sure...\r\nbut also because we have the hope that we might find more information there.",
    "svo0301_122": "Um, i-if you don't mind, why don't you come with us?\r\nIt would be better to work together.",
    "svo0301_123": "That would make it easier to deal with monsters.\r\nPlus, there's been talk of PKers going around who are bad news.",
    "svo0301_124": "Sounds good if you ask me!",
    "svo0301_125": "No objections here!",
    "svo0301_126": "Here either.",
    "svo0301_127": "...",
    "svo0301_128": "Okay. Let's join up.",
    "svo0301_129": "Wise choice, boy.",
    "svo0301_130": "...",
    "svo0301_131": "You be quiet.",
    "svo0301_132": "Wasn't there someone else? The one who you're supposed to be protecting\r\nwhile you look for the Test Room.",
    "svo0301_133": "Monsters are one thing, but PKers, too?\r\nIs she gonna be okay?",
    "svo0301_134": "Yeah. Her name's Fuuka.",
    "svo0301_135": "But now that you mention it, she's been gone a long time.\r\nYou guys didn't run into her, did you?",
    "svo0301_136": "She's about the same age as Leafa and Lisbeth.",
    "svo0301_137": "I can't say I've seen anyone like that.",
    "svo0301_138": "Do you think something happened to her?\r\nMaybe we start sea—",
    "svo0301_139": "Hi. What are you talking about?",
    "svo0301_140": "!",
    "svo0301_141": "Wow, there are more of you! Talk about a party!",
    "svo0301_142": "You've been gone for a while. What were you doing?",
    "svo0301_143": "Oh, sorry. I only meant to scout for a bit, but I went too far.",
    "svo0301_144": "How far?",
    "svo0301_145": "Well—",
    "svo0301_146": "Shhh!",
    "svo0301_147": "What is it, Neige?",
    "svo0301_148": "I think—\r\nNo, I definitely heard something.",
    "svo0301_149": "I'm sorry. Could you all come with me?",
    "svo0302_001": "Where did the voice come from?\r\nThis way?",
    "svo0302_002": "Y-Yes. I couldn't pick up what it was saying,\r\nbut it sounded like someone crying for help.",
    "svo0302_003": "We didn't hear a thing...",
    "svo0302_004": "Are you absolutely sure, girl?",
    "svo0302_005": "I, uh, um...\r\nN-No?",
    "svo0302_006": "Well, if it was just her imagination, it was just her imagination.\r\nThat means there was no one in danger, which is a good thing in my book.",
    "svo0302_007": "It's rocky ahead. Pretty hard to see.",
    "svo0302_008": "Should I scout ahead?",
    "svo0302_009": "Let me go with you. It always helps to have a buddy.",
    "svo0302_010": "I know my way around doing recon too, so I won't drag you down.\r\nProbably.",
    "svo0302_011": "Sure. 'Preciate it.",
    "svo0302_012": "Okay then. Do you mind? Come right back if it looks dangerous.",
    "svo0302_013": "Roger that.",
    "svo0302_014": "You got it.",
    "svo0302_015": "Be careful, you two.",
    "svo0302_016": "A voice crying for help, huh?",
    "svo0302_017": "I think anyone would want help if they suddenly found themselves lost in a place\r\nlike this.",
    "svo0302_018": "I hope we'll be able to do something for them.",
    "svo0302_019": "Yeah... You're a good guy. I can tell these things.",
    "svo0302_020": "Huh? Th-Thanks.",
    "svo0302_021": "Isn't helping each other out at a time like this just what you do?",
    "svo0302_022": "Well, sure.",
    "svo0302_023": "The fact that it's so easy for you to say lines like that means you always think\r\nthat way.",
    "svo0302_024": "Not everyone can do that.",
    "svo0302_025": "Especially not you, Klein. Maybe only when you're trying to show off in front of\r\nthe ladies.",
    "svo0302_026": "H-Hey! I-I... I'm a man who takes action!\r\nAnd actions speak louder than words!",
    "svo0302_027": "Don't worry, you've helped us too, Klein.\r\nThank you.",
    "svo0302_028": "Yeah, yeah! We're super grateful!",
    "svo0302_029": "What surprises me, though...",
    "svo0302_030": "Is that you're helping them, Administrator.",
    "svo0302_031": "I'd prefer you call me Quinella in this place, boy.",
    "svo0302_032": "So helping others and aiding those in need is something you do now?",
    "svo0302_033": "(I sense a little tension between Eugeo and Quinella.)",
    "svo0302_034": "(Yeah. They seem to know each other. Do you think they don't get along?)",
    "svo0302_035": "You wound me. It is my duty to love, rule, and save the weak.\r\nWhat is so strange about exercising my power to do so?",
    "svo0302_036": "Exercising your power, huh?\r\nIf you think saying that now absolves you from what you did to Alice, I—",
    "svo0302_037": "All right, that's enough, both of you!",
    "svo0302_038": "Look. The world is in chaos. Lots of people are suffering.\r\nWe don't have time to bicker.",
    "svo0302_039": "What we should be doing right now is working together to figure out what to do\r\nand how we can help.",
    "svo0302_040": "You'll have plenty of time to settle your scores after that.\r\nCan you handle that, Eugeo?",
    "svo0302_041": "And as for you, Quinella, you don't have to egg him on.\r\nPlease, give it a rest!",
    "svo0302_042": "...",
    "svo0302_043": "...",
    "svo0302_044": "Looks like our scouts are back.",
    "svo0302_045": "How'd it go?",
    "svo0302_046": "We found a basin with a cage in the middle.",
    "svo0302_047": "And there was a girl inside.\r\nWe didn't see any monsters around, but...",
    "svo0302_048": "It seemed like a trap?",
    "svo0302_049": "Yeah. Really fishy.",
    "svo0302_050": "The area around the cage has no cover.\r\nIf we barge in and try to save her, we'll be surrounded for sure.",
    "svo0302_051": "It's exactly like when we saved Klein!\r\nWe got attacked when we tried to let him out!",
    "svo0302_052": "You got captured?",
    "svo0302_053": "I-It's not like I did anything stupid, okay?\r\nI was set up!",
    "svo0302_054": "Anyway, enough about me! We have to save the girl!\r\nWhat was the sitch?",
    "svo0302_055": "We couldn't tell if she was a player or an NPC.\r\nShe was young. Maybe ten years old.",
    "svo0302_056": "We'd better hurry then.",
    "svo0302_057": "Oh, and one thing 'bout the girl, Kii-boy.",
    "svo0302_058": "Hm? What's that?",
    "svo0302_059": "Can't say for sure seein' as she was so far away.\r\nBut...",
    "svo0302_060": "No, never mind. We don't have time to stress over the what-ifs. We'd better just get in gear and see for ourselves. Come on!",
    "svo0302_061": "R-Right.",
    "svo0302_062": "Is that it? I see the cage.",
    "svo0302_063": "They're hiding, but I can feel the monsters' presence.",
    "svo0302_064": "There's no point in going out there to be surrounded.\r\nLet's move cautiously and quietly.",
    "svo0302_065": "We could pick them off from behind.",
    "svo0302_066": "Take them by surprise. I like it.",
    "svo0302_067": "Hold up there, Kii-boy. Take a good look at the girl.",
    "svo0302_068": "Hm? I can't make her out from here—",
    "svo0302_069": "!",
    "svo0302_070": "Sorry, guys! Back me up!",
    "svo0302_071": "You're leaping in by yourself?\r\nKirito!",
    "svo0302_072": "Whatever happened to cautious and efficient?\r\nWho could this girl be?",
    "svo0302_073": "Could it be little Yui?!",
    "svo0302_074": "Oh... Th-That seems pretty likely.",
    "svo0302_075": "We can't hang back here with her in danger. Everyone, follow Kirito!",
    "svo0302_076": "Yui!",
    "svo0302_077": "Daddy!",
    "svo0302_078": "I'm sorry I took so long. Were you scared?",
    "svo0302_079": "No. Because I knew you would come for me, Daddy!",
    "svo0302_080": "Sorry for running out on my own, everyone.",
    "svo0302_081": "You're unbelievable.\r\nI was wondering what could have made you lose your cool like that.",
    "svo0302_082": "Always jumping into action without explaining a thing, aren'tcha?",
    "svo0302_083": "I only did it because I knew you guys had my back.",
    "svo0302_084": "Well, we did do a number on those monsters.",
    "svo0302_085": "I'm happy you came to help me, but Mommy's gonna get mad at you again\r\nif you keep being so reckless!",
    "svo0302_086": "I'll be careful next time.",
    "svo0302_087": "These must be your friends.\r\nHello.",
    "svo0302_088": "I'm Yui. It's nice to meet you!",
    "svo0302_088_2": "By the way, when I say \"Daddy,\" I mean Kirito of course!",
    "svo0302_089": "Y-Yeah. Nice to meet you.",
    "svo0302_090": "Hey. Kirito. Why did she call you \"Daddy\"?\r\nIs she your daughter?",
    "svo0302_091": "Y-Yeah.",
    "svo0302_092": "Meaning you were married before you became a Lost Child of Vecta?!",
    "svo0302_093": "I must say I'm unaware of the customs in your world.\r\nI didn't expect you were of child-rearing age, boy.",
    "svo0302_094": "Hmm. So you already had a wife, then.",
    "svo0302_095": "You started a family of your own?\r\nI guess appearances can be deceiving.",
    "svo0302_096": "That's not exactly the whole story.",
    "svo0302_097": "So you're denying it?\r\nI don't think Asuna and Yui are gonna like that.",
    "svo0302_098": "N-No, I don't deny it. And she is my daughter.\r\nHow should I explain this?",
    "svo0302_099": "This Yui girl is an AI, correct? Like me.",
    "svo0302_100": "That's right! I was originally the Mental Health Counseling Program deployed\r\nin Sword Art Online.",
    "svo0302_101": "Oh. That must be why she heard you calling for help.",
    "svo0302_102": "Anyway, I'll explain the rest later.",
    "svo0302_103": "You'd better.",
    "svo0302_104": "I-I will.\r\nPromise.",
    "svo0302_105": "How did you end up here, Yui?",
    "svo0302_106": "I'm not really sure. The last thing I remember is waking up as a captive\r\nin a world I didn't recognize.",
    "svo0302_107": "In addition, all of my permissions have been blocked.\r\nAs I am now, I'm no different from a player, like all of you.",
    "svo0302_108": "So you don't know any more than we do about the situation.\r\nThis might be a huge deal.",
    "svo0302_109": "I'm sorry, Daddy.",
    "svo0302_110": "It's okay. This isn't your fault.\r\nI'm just glad you're safe.",
    "svo0302_111": "You must have been through a lot.",
    "svo0302_112": "Not at all! And now I get to be with Daddy and all of you!",
    "svo0302_113": "Yui, was it? May I ask you a question?",
    "svo0302_114": "Y-Yes.",
    "svo0302_115": "Earlier, you referred to this place as \"a world you didn't recognize.\"",
    "svo0302_116": "By that, did you mean that the world you were brought to was not an altered\r\nor merged version of worlds you had previous memories of...",
    "svo0302_117": "...but an entirely new world you had no knowledge of?",
    "svo0302_118": "I don't have any proof yet, but... I believe that is a reasonable assumption.\r\nI detected a change in the system immediately before this happened.",
    "svo0302_119": "Well, we just came through ALO and GGO.\r\nCould that mean those two worlds got stuck together?",
    "svo0302_120": "Yes. Rather than the two worlds merging...",
    "svo0302_121": "The objects which made up each of them, as well as the players inside,\r\nwere transported to an entirely new world.",
    "svo0302_122": "This may be the work of someone who possesses unknown technology.",
    "svo0302_123": "You mean it was intentional? I heard there was an error in Galaxia's system.\r\nCould that have caused it?",
    "svo0302_124": "It may be related, but I don't believe a simple system error would be able\r\nto cause such a large-scale phenomenon.",
    "svo0302_125": "Gotcha.",
    "svo0302_126": "So what you're saying is, uh... What are you saying, exactly?",
    "svo0302_127": "Basically, it just got complicated.",
    "svo0302_128": "If this is some other world and not part of the game, it means the devs can't do\r\nanything. Plus, if there's some kinda unknown tech involved, I doubt a patch'll \r\nfix it.",
    "svo0302_129": "So... We can't do anything about it?\r\nThat's not what I wanted to hear.",
    "svo0302_130": "Well, we have more allies now.\r\nLet's go back to the cabin for now and decide what to do next.",
    "svo0302_131": "...Daddy.",
    "svo0302_132": "Hm? What is it, Yui?",
    "svo0302_133": "Did I say something bad?\r\nEveryone looks so sad now.",
    "svo0302_134": "You didn't do anything wrong. It was important information.\r\nAnd if you're right, we would have had to face it sooner or later.",
    "svo0302_135": "What we do next depends.",
    "svo0302_136": "We still haven't gotten Fuuka and Neige to the Test Room.\r\nWe might be able to find out something there.",
    "svo0302_137": "I know we'll figure it out.\r\nDaddy's got this!",
    "svo0302_138": "Okay!",
    "svo0302_139": "Is Mommy not with you?",
    "svo0302_140": "I haven't seen her since I got here.\r\nShe's probably out there somewhere fighting too.",
    "svo0302_141": "Of course, I hope she didn't get mixed up in all this.",
    "svo0302_142": "Mommy isn't far.",
    "svo0302_143": "I've lost most of my navigation functions, but I can still feel her.",
    "svo0302_144": "Is that right? Okay, I trust you.",
    "svo0302_145": "In that case, we'll have to put our chins up and keep going so we can find Mommy\r\nwith our heads held high!",
    "svo0303_001": "This forest seems to go on forever.",
    "svo0303_002": "Yeah. In The Real World, you'd end up somewhere as long as you kept walking.",
    "svo0303_003": "But we can't assume regular logic applies in this world.",
    "svo0303_004": "We may be unable to leave until we meet certain requirements.",
    "svo0303_005": "This is reminiscent of the Forest of Wandering on Floor 35.",
    "svo0303_006": "I have a feeling I've seen the sign on this tree before.",
    "svo0303_007": "So we're stuck in a loop.",
    "svo0303_008": "Yes. Perhaps we should check how far we can walk in each direction before it\r\nloops.",
    "svo0303_009": "We've confirmed the forest loops in all of the cardinal directions.\r\nIt seems we'll never escape by merely moving forward.",
    "svo0303_010": "You'd never notice that it loops forever if you weren't paying attention,\r\nthe scenery never changes.",
    "svo0303_011": "Whoever made this map had some shady intentions.",
    "svo0303_012": "I wonder if Akihiko Kayaba designed all of Aincrad's tricks.\r\nIf so, he was pretty messed up.",
    "svo0303_013": "Without a doubt. He was definitely the type of broken individual who relishes\r\nwatching others suffer.",
    "svo0303_014": "Putting that aside...",
    "svo0303_015": "How should we handle this situation? Any opinions?",
    "svo0303_016": "(What would Kirito do?)",
    "svo0303_017": "(He wouldn't get hung up thinking about it.\r\nHe would take action and find a way out.)",
    "svo0303_018": "(And I'd support him until we found a way. That's what we always do.)",
    "svo0303_019": "(Kirito, where are you?)",
    "svo0303_020": "Asuna?",
    "svo0303_021": "O-Oh! Well...",
    "svo0303_022": "This map is easy to get lost in, but doesn't seem very big.",
    "svo0303_023": "It has several crossroads within a limited area,\r\nand going straight loops you back around.",
    "svo0303_024": "There must be a correct way to go.",
    "svo0303_025": "Yeah, maps that loop if you don't follow the right path are an RPG staple.",
    "svo0303_026": "Trying patterns one-by-one might be our best bet.",
    "svo0303_027": "I see. Logical.",
    "svo0303_028": "I agree. Let's give that a try.",
    "svo0303_029": "Shall we split up? That way will be faster.",
    "svo0303_030": "I think that's too risky.\r\nIt would be hard to deal with any monsters that show up.",
    "svo0303_031": "We should stick together, even if it takes longer.",
    "svo0303_032": "Slow and steady, then.",
    "svo0303_033": "What do you think, Fukaziroh?\r\nYou'll have to stay with us for a while longer.",
    "svo0303_034": "I don't mind. Sticking together is safer, no matter how you slice it.",
    "svo0303_035": "Good. Shall we go, then?",
    "svo0303_036": "Roger.",
    "svo0303_037": "Roger.",
    "svo0303_038": "You Knights of the Blood Oath sure know how to work as a team.\r\nYou're all on the same page.",
    "svo0303_039": "I've teamed up before, but it always broke down when someone went berserk\r\nor stabbed everyone else in the back. You know?",
    "svo0303_040": "That doesn't sound so bad, though. Kind of fun.\r\nIn my regular party, we—",
    "svo0303_041": "(Regular party?)",
    "svo0303_042": "(When did I have a regular party?)",
    "svo0303_043": "Asuna? What's wrong?",
    "svo0303_044": "It's nothing...",
    "svo0303_045": "This place looks different. I think this means we've escaped.",
    "svo0303_046": "There's a monster waiting ahead.\r\nA strong-looking one, at that.",
    "svo0303_047": "Speaking in game terms, I'd say this is where we'd find the midboss.\r\nMeaning if we beat it, we're out of this place.",
    "svo0303_048": "Come to think of it, Nautilus, didn't you...?",
    "svo0303_049": "Hm? Didn't I what?",
    "svo0303_050": "N-Nothing.",
    "svo0303_051": "(What was I about to say?)",
    "svo0303_052": "(I feel like I just remembered something happening to Nautilus during a midboss\r\nfight. And suddenly felt inexplicably uneasy.)",
    "svo0303_053": "(Am I imagining things?)",
    "svo0303_054": "Let's make quick work of this boss and say goodbye to this creepy-ass forest!",
    "svo0303_055": "You're done for!",
    "svo0303_056": "The boss monster has been eliminated.",
    "svo0303_057": "Good work, everyone. Thank you for your help, Fukaziroh.",
    "svo0303_058": "(Nautilus fought just fine. Was that just my imagination after all?)",
    "svo0303_059": "What about this? It appeared after we killed the boss.",
    "svo0303_060": "Stairs leading underground?",
    "svo0303_061": "They must lead to a dungeon. I expect this to get even more dangerous.\r\nWhat shall we do?",
    "svo0304_001": "Ick, the air down here is so humid it feels like I'm swimming in it.",
    "svo0304_002": "Is this your first dungeon crawl, Fukaziroh?",
    "svo0304_003": "Huh? I'm not sure.",
    "svo0304_004": "Well, I find it unlikely someone as skilled as yourself will hold us back.",
    "svo0304_005": "You seem dissatisfied, Asuna.\r\nI suppose you were opposed to entering the dungeon with Fukaziroh.",
    "svo0304_006": "You were?",
    "svo0304_007": "I recognize that you're talented enough.",
    "svo0304_008": "But dungeons are different.\r\nThey tend to be more treacherous than anything in the overworld.",
    "svo0304_009": "Ideally, you'd only ever go into one with party members you're already used to\r\ncoordinating with.",
    "svo0304_010": "We don't have much of a choice. When the way into the dungeon opened,\r\nthe way back into the forest closed at the same time.",
    "svo0304_011": "We can't leave her here alone.\r\nThat would be far worse than braving the dungeon.",
    "svo0304_012": "You have a point, but...",
    "svo0304_013": "(I still can't get over this feeling.)",
    "svo0304_014": "(It's like something impossible is happening.\r\nLike I'm stuck on a path someone set for me.)",
    "svo0304_015": "You're right. We'll have to keep going.",
    "svo0304_016": "Now, shall I give you a crash course on the ins and outs of dungeon crawling?",
    "svo0304_017": "First of all, dungeons are cramped places. Low in both visibility and moveable\r\nspace. Thus, it is important to always be on your guard for monster attacks.",
    "svo0304_018": "The simplest way to do this is by staying in formation.\r\nEach member of the party will fill the role suited to the position they are in,\r\nprotecting the group as efficiently as possible.",
    "svo0304_019": "In this party, I would be most effective in the lead position.\r\nYou will guard the rear and provide supporting fire in any encounters.",
    "svo0304_020": "Sure thing!",
    "svo0304_021": "Asuna and Nautilus, you will be one step in front of Fukaziroh,\r\nguarding our flanks. We move without breaking formation.",
    "svo0304_022": "Roger.",
    "svo0304_023": "Understood. I feel reassured with you taking the lead, Commander.\r\nWe may not even be of much help to you.",
    "svo0304_024": "Don't get complacent, Nautilus.",
    "svo0304_025": "You're the least experienced of the Knights of the Blood Oath.\r\nA single instant of carelessness is all it takes to lose your life.",
    "svo0304_026": "I know that. Don't worry, I won't allow myself to be beaten in here.",
    "svo0304_027": "Because I have a reason to go home.",
    "svo0304_028": "There are monsters directly ahead.\r\nBreak through!",
    "svo0304_029": "What's the status?",
    "svo0304_030": "They... gave up?",
    "svo0304_031": "No. They lost sight of us, but they're still wandering the area.",
    "svo0304_032": "There are a lot more of them than I thought there'd be.\r\nCould this be an infinite spawn point?",
    "svo0304_033": "There's no way to be sure.\r\nIt would be difficult to force our way through.",
    "svo0304_034": "This dungeon must have been designed for a larger party.\r\nWe'll have to take a different approach.",
    "svo0304_035": "You're good at keeping it cool in dangerous situations, huh?\r\nAre you one of those lives-for-the-fight, thrill-seeking types?",
    "svo0304_036": "I wouldn't say that.",
    "svo0304_037": "But I suppose I do tend to find the unknown and unexpected quite exhilarating.",
    "svo0304_038": "Whatever direction it goes, an expectation defied is a brilliant source of fresh\r\nexcitement.",
    "svo0304_039": "This isn't the time to be chatting. What do we do?\r\nThe entrance is a little ways back too.",
    "svo0304_040": "Even if we did make it there, it would only be a dead end.\r\nThe way back to the forest is shut.",
    "svo0304_041": "If you ask me, we should drive in and push past these enemies.\r\nStaying in here too long will worry Yuna.",
    "svo0304_042": "Oh, who's this Yuna? Your girlfriend?",
    "svo0304_043": "N-No! Just a friend. For now.",
    "svo0304_044": "She loves singing.\r\nIf I can make it to the city, I'm sure I'll find—",
    "svo0304_045": "Shhh!",
    "svo0304_046": "What happened here? There are signs of a struggle...",
    "svo0304_047": "Monsters fighting amongst themselves?\r\nOr someone coming to help us?",
    "svo0304_048": "The latter, I hope. But to avoid potential disappointment,\r\nI'm not going to count on it just yet.",
    "svo0304_049": "No, I think in this case you can.",
    "svo0304_050": "Oh?",
    "svo0304_051": "I hear voices. And human footsteps.\r\nA lot of them.",
    "svo0304_052": "Is somebody there?",
    "svo0304_053": "!",
    "svo0305_001": "We have a handle on the situation and manpower to spare.\r\nWe'll clean up the monsters around the perimeter first.",
    "svo0305_002": "You focus on protecting yourselves.\r\nI'll contact you after the threat is dealt with.",
    "svo0305_003": "Understood.\r\nPlease, be careful.",
    "svo0305_004": "You too.",
    "svo0305_005": "Let's talk again after we've gotten through.",
    "svo0305_006": "Was that Asuna's voice? That was Asuna, wasn't it?!",
    "svo0305_007": "Unmistakably.",
    "svo0305_008": "I knew it! We have to meet up with her!",
    "svo0305_009": "Don't get ahead of yourself, Yuuki. We have to prioritize taking care\r\nof the monsters.",
    "svo0305_010": "I also sensed something wrong from her voice.\r\nIt could be...",
    "svo0305_011": "Oh, right.\r\nIt could be that \"scrambled cognition\" thing Cardinal was talking about!",
    "svo0305_012": "Okay. We have to take care of the monsters first so we can take our time talking\r\nabout it.",
    "svo0305_013": "That's right. All units, I expect you'll give this everything you have!",
    "svo0305_014": "You bet!",
    "svo0305_015": "Is that all of them?",
    "svo0305_016": "Wow, there were so many of them!",
    "svo0305_017": "I almost panicked. I'm glad I had all of you with me.",
    "svo0305_018": "You fought just fine. Good work.",
    "svo0305_019": "Are Asuna and the others okay?",
    "svo0305_020": "Yeah. Alice went to get them and—\r\nSpeak of the devil. She's back.",
    "svo0305_021": "I've brought Asuna and the others.\r\nA bit exhausted, but there are no serious injuries.",
    "svo0305_022": "So you're the ones who saved us.\r\nThank you.",
    "svo0305_023": "It would have been a dire situation without your help.",
    "svo0305_024": "Asuna! I knew it was you!",
    "svo0305_025": "Eh? Yes, my name is Asuna.",
    "svo0305_026": "I'm sorry, have we met?",
    "svo0305_027": "*gasp*",
    "svo0305_028": "Let me ask you something.",
    "svo0305_029": "You're Asuna, Vice Commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.\r\nIs that right?",
    "svo0305_030": "Yes, that's me. What's gotten into you, Agil?",
    "svo0305_031": "Nothing. And that's Commander Heathcliff, correct?",
    "svo0305_032": "Yes. We can't thank you enough for your help.",
    "svo0305_033": "(Man, I didn't expect to find Asuna here. And especially not Heathcliff.)",
    "svo0305_034": "(Isn't that Akihiko Kayaba?!)",
    "svo0305_035": "Is there something on my face?",
    "svo0305_036": "Oh! S-Sorry! It's just that you're so famous!",
    "svo0305_037": "I'm impressed with how you handled so many monsters, Agil.",
    "svo0305_038": "Even we Knights of the Blood Oath couldn't have handled that so well.\r\nYou have some skill.",
    "svo0305_039": "(Mmm. So she knows me, but not Silica or the others.)",
    "svo0305_040": "(And she thinks she's still part of the Knights of the Blood Oath.)",
    "svo0305_041": "(Meaning...)",
    "svo0305_042": "(It's just as Cardinal said.)",
    "svo0305_043": "(And add to that a few of those \"outsiders.\")",
    "svo0305_044": "I see a lot of new faces here.\r\nWhich guild are you all from?",
    "svo0305_045": "...",
    "svo0305_046": "What's the matter?",
    "svo0305_047": "Hmph.",
    "svo0305_048": "He seems to be familiar with Asuna and I, at least.",
    "svo0305_049": "This is Fukaziroh. As you can likely tell she's not a member of the guild.\r\nWe met in the forest and were traveling through this dungeon together.",
    "svo0305_050": "Name's Fukaziroh. Thanks for the help.",
    "svo0305_051": "There's one more member of our party who was keeping watch from the rear.",
    "svo0305_052": "There's no danger, Commander.\r\nThe monsters seem to be—",
    "svo0305_053": "Eiji!",
    "svo0305_054": "Huh? Uh, Yuna?!",
    "svo0305_055": "No, it can't be. You look like her, but you can't be. Can you?\r\nWho in the world are you?",
    "svo0305_056": "I'm... I'm...",
    "svo0305_057": "It's okay, Yuna. Remember what Cardinal said.",
    "svo0305_058": "It'll be okay. He'll remember.",
    "svo0305_059": "Okay.",
    "svo0305_060": "I should introduce my companions as well,\r\nbut this does not seem like the right time or place.",
    "svo0305_061": "It is fortunate that we were able to help you.\r\nHowever, our mission is to take down the boss of this dungeon.",
    "svo0305_062": "I found what looks like the boss door up this way.\r\nThat's where we're headed.",
    "svo0305_063": "Do you think you can lend us a hand?\r\nIf you have any to spare, that is.",
    "svo0306_001": "As I said before, it is an unfortunate truth that this is an extremely unstable world.",
    "svo0306_002": "Data from different spacetimes has been thrown into this ambiguous one,\r\nmaking it appear somewhat functional, but only on the surface.\r\n",
    "svo0306_003": "As a result, entities that exist here are easily influenced by the thoughts\r\nand emotions of others.",
    "svo0306_004": "This includes their appearance, memories, and perception.\r\nThey aren't even aware of the change.",
    "svo0306_005": "Let us call it \"cognitive contamination.\"",
    "svo0306_006": "Um... Does that mean there might be people who are missing memories?",
    "svo0306_007": "That too, but by the sound of it, far worse things could happen.",
    "svo0306_008": "If our memories and perception can change, does that mean you could start\r\nbelieving you are an entirely different person or even have recollections\r\nthat never happened?",
    "svo0306_009": "It certainly is possible.",
    "svo0306_010": "You'll probably come across such people in your travels as you seek out\r\ninformation and supporters.",
    "svo0306_011": "If you wish to return them to normal—",
    "svo0306_012": "That must be why Asuna thinks she's Vice Commander of\r\nthe Knights of the Blood Oath.",
    "svo0306_013": "Yeah. The other three are likely going through the same thing.\r\nTo them, they're still in SAO.",
    "svo0306_014": "But we remember everything... It's making me feel kinda lonely.",
    "svo0306_015": "Yeah, it is...",
    "svo0306_016": "One of them must still have a strong attachment to SAO,\r\nand that one is affecting the other three.",
    "svo0306_017": "And that one may not even realize that they are the cause.",
    "svo0306_018": "According to what Cardinal said, they'll go back to normal if we can get them to\r\nremember their true memories.",
    "svo0306_019": "Figuring out who the source is and getting them to come to their senses will\r\nreturn everyone else to normal too.",
    "svo0306_020": "It might make them feel responsible and regretful,\r\nbut I guess that can't be avoided.",
    "svo0306_021": "But which one is it? Asuna? Heathcliff? Eiji? Or maybe Fukaziroh?",
    "svo0306_022": "Hmph. Heathcliff is the obvious answer.\r\nI've no doubt it was that bastard, Kayaba!",
    "svo0306_023": "A man like him would have no issue with meddling with the consciousness of\r\nothers, neither practically nor morally.",
    "svo0306_024": "He was the mastermind behind the SAO Incident!\r\nOf course, he's attached to his grand experiment!",
    "svo0306_025": "Heh heh heh.",
    "svo0306_026": "What?",
    "svo0306_027": "Everyone knows what he did.\r\nIt's common knowledge.",
    "svo0306_028": "But it sounds to me like you have a personal grudge.\r\nYou knew him, didn't you?",
    "svo0306_029": "No comment. Mind your own business.",
    "svo0306_030": "Let's get back on topic, guys.",
    "svo0306_031": "We can probably exclude Fukaziroh, since all her gear is GGO stuff.",
    "svo0306_032": "You think? I'm not so sure we should jump to that conclusion.\r\nI'm sure there are SAO survivors who play GGO.",
    "svo0306_033": "I get the impression that the Knights of the Blood Oath would have stronger\r\nmemories of SAO than her.",
    "svo0306_034": "But we don't have any evidence, so there's nothing to go on.",
    "svo0306_035": "Hmm... We can worry about that later.\r\nLet's take down the boss first!",
    "svo0306_036": "Excuse me... May I have everyone's attention?",
    "svo0306_037": "Yes?",
    "svo0306_038": "We investigated the boss door, and there seems to be some kind of trick to it.",
    "svo0306_039": "Unfortunately, we weren't able to figure out what the trick is. We don't have any lockpicking skills, either. You don't have a Thief among you, do you?",
    "svo0306_040": "I've thought about it, and...",
    "svo0306_041": "Since we know it could be a trap, we should have those of us with the thickest\r\narmor open it. That's the commander and Nautilus.",
    "svo0306_042": "You want to send Eiji?\r\nIsn't that dangerous?",
    "svo0306_043": "It could be.",
    "svo0306_044": "It's rare that a single trap could prove fatal.\r\nThat doesn't mean we can guarantee it'll be safe, though.",
    "svo0306_045": "You sure about this? The Knights of the Blood Oath'll be shouldering\r\nthe entire burden.",
    "svo0306_046": "You saved us. Now it's our turn.\r\nBesides, Nautilus said he wants to repay you.",
    "svo0306_047": "...",
    "svo0306_048": "The rest of you, make some distance and be ready in case something happens.",
    "svo0306_049": "Very well. I leave this in your hands.\r\nMay the grace of Stacia be with you.",
    "svo0306_050": "\"Stacia?\"\r\nOh, uh, thanks.",
    "svo0306_051": "Let's do it at once, then.",
    "svo0306_052": "Are you ready, Nautilus?",
    "svo0306_053": "Yes. I'm opening the door.",
    "svo0306_054": "...",
    "svo0306_055": "...",
    "svo0306_056": "...",
    "svo0306_057": "It won't open?",
    "svo0306_058": "I'm pushing. But it won't budge.",
    "svo0306_059": "No, I see it slowly opening by itself.\r\nWe should be able to pass if we wait long enough.",
    "svo0306_060": "What the heck is that?\r\nIs that the trick to get in?",
    "svo0306_061": "Hmm...\r\nThe door mechanism seems to be linked to another device on the other side.",
    "svo0306_062": "It doesn't seem to be something that deals damage.\r\nIf I had to guess, it seems to be some sort of decoy.",
    "svo0306_063": "I see. Weakening intruders right before the boss battle would be an effective strategy. That likely means...",
    "svo0306_064": "Uh, what do you mean?",
    "svo0306_065": "Basically—",
    "svo0306_066": "BZZZZZ!",
    "svo0306_067": "It's an alarm! Monsters are coming!",
    "svo0306_068": "...That we'll be flooded with monsters until the door opens.",
    "svo0306_069": "Finish your thoughts faster next time!",
    "svo0306_070": "Eek! They're crowding in!",
    "svo0306_071": "E-Everyone get into formation!\r\nWe have to fight them off!",
    "svo0306_072": "Is everyone inside?\r\nI'm shutting the door!",
    "svo0306_073": "Phew! Is everyone here?",
    "svo0306_074": "I'm fine.",
    "svo0306_075": "That was awful! We managed to get through it, though.",
    "svo0306_076": "Heh. Hehehe. At least, there's never a dull moment.",
    "svo0306_077": "You're one to talk, hiding on the ground like that!",
    "svo0306_078": "Personally, I'd rather be safe, even if it's boring.\r\nLooks like the corridor keeps going.",
    "svo0306_079": "It leads to an open space.\r\nAnd probably more monsters.",
    "svo0306_080": "Yes, it fills me with dread.",
    "svo0306_081": "We'll most likely encounter the boss ahead.\r\nWe should decide our strategy before it attacks.",
    "svo0306_082": "Although, with this many people I suppose it would be\r\nunrealistic to practice coordinating attacks now.",
    "svo0306_083": "If we set a rule to not let the timing of our attacks and switches overlap, could that work?",
    "svo0306_084": "I believe so.\r\nAttempting to control every aspect of the battle will only cause confusion.",
    "svo0306_085": "A boss battle with a thrown-together party, huh?\r\nI know we don't have a choice, but...",
    "svo0306_086": "Nervous?",
    "svo0306_087": "That's something I can't deny.\r\nWe're taking on a boss without a full raid party and no intel.",
    "svo0306_088": "Plus—",
    "svo0306_089": "(Something about Nautilus fighting a boss still bothers me.)",
    "svo0306_090": "Is something the matter, Asuna?",
    "svo0306_091": "No, I'm fine.",
    "svo0306_092": "(Am I really fine? Can I actually fight in this state?)",
    "svo0306_093": "(I'm the vice commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.\r\nIt's my duty to take the lead.)",
    "svo0306_094": "(But what if I can't focus on the battle and drag everybody down?)",
    "svo0306_095": "(If we all get killed because of me...)",
    "svo0306_096": "Eep!",
    "svo0306_097": "Don't worry Asuna! We can do this!",
    "svo0306_098": "H-Huh? Y-Yuuki?",
    "svo0306_099": "Being overly optimistic without actually doing what needs to be done,\r\nthat's just careless! But we're gonna give it our all, right?",
    "svo0306_100": "So you've got nothing to be nervous about! There's no point in worrying about\r\nthings that are out of your control. Just trust us. Trust yourself.",
    "svo0306_101": "Did I hit the nail on the head or what?",
    "svo0306_102": "...",
    "svo0306_103": "I guess you did.",
    "svo0306_104": "Sure, how we got together was kind of random, but we're capable!\r\nLet's go beat that boss together!",
    "svo0306_105": "Okay... Let's do it!",
    "svo0306_106": "Hehe! It's reassuring, hearing that from you.",
    "svo0306_107": "Hm?",
    "svo0306_108": "Being told we can win from the girl who wanted to beat a boss with only one\r\nparty makes me feel like we really can.",
    "svo0306_109": "!",
    "svo0306_110": "Asuna, what did you just say?!",
    "svo0306_111": "Huh? Oh, I, um...",
    "svo0306_112": "You just said I wanted to beat the boss with one party, didn't you?",
    "svo0306_113": "Y-Yes. Didn't you tell me once that you and your party wanted to clear a floor\r\nboss by yourselves?",
    "svo0306_114": "I did. Do you remember when that was?",
    "svo0306_115": "I think we had a duel in ALO, and then...",
    "svo0306_116": "But wait...\r\nI only started ALO after I got out of SAO.",

    "svo0306_132": "Would you mind catching me up on what happened?",
    "svo0306_133": "It might be best to explain this before we go up against that boss.",
    "svo0306_134": "\"Cognitive contamination.\" It's hard to believe that kind of infection can alter\r\nyour memories and perception of reality.",
    "svo0306_135": "And that it spreads from others.",
    "svo0306_136": "H-Huh? Does that mean that this isn't really Aincrad from SAO?",
    "svo0306_137": "Hmm? Now that you mention it...",
    "svo0306_138": "What is this? I don't understand.",
    "svo0306_139": "Hmm.",
    "svo0306_140": "(Thanks to Yuuki, I got my memories back.)",
    "svo0306_141": "(But the other three haven't, which means I'm not the one who triggered the\r\ncontamination.)",
    "svo0306_142": "(The most likely culprit is...)",
    "svo0307_001": "I don't think Fukaziroh ever played SAO.",
    "svo0307_002": "She's in GGO gear even though she's supposed to be in SAO.",
    "svo0307_003": "Since this world is based off our perception,\r\nif she had a subconscious desire to return to SAO...",
    "svo0307_004": "Her gear would have changed to be consistent with that desire without her even\r\nrealizing it.",
    "svo0307_005": "I think Fukaziroh didn't have a mental image of SAO's gear and systems at all.",
    "svo0307_006": "The other two would fit if you're right.",
    "svo0307_007": "But who would want to go back to that?\r\nWould anyone actually want to relive it?",
    "svo0307_008": "Right. I only know what I've heard about it,\r\nbut it was a horrible life-or-death situation, right?",
    "svo0307_009": "You'd think everyone would be trying to overcome it,\r\nwhether by forgetting or by facing it head-on.",
    "svo0307_010": "I wonder if some would rather just go back?",
    "svo0307_011": "Heh heh.\r\nThat depends on the person, doesn't it?",
    "svo0307_012": "That is true.\r\nFor the vast majority of the victims it was a nightmare.",
    "svo0307_013": "But one of the men before us is no victim! He was the only one to experience SAO\r\nof his own free will!",
    "svo0307_014": "...",
    "svo0307_015": "Heathcliff, Commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath.\r\nOr should I say Akihiko Kayaba? We've got your number.",
    "svo0307_016": "The mastermind behind SAO.",
    "svo0307_017": "He's bitter that SAO was cleared before anyone made it to the top floor\r\nand he wants a do-over! He's clearly the source of the contamination!",
    "svo0307_018": "No.",
    "svo0307_019": "I don't think it was the commander.\r\nHe's not the one who pulled everyone into his deluded reality.",
    "svo0307_020": "What?",
    "svo0307_021": "May I ask why you believe that, Asuna?",
    "svo0307_022": "Because you've been taking the lead from the time we were exploring the forest\r\nuntil we got to this very room.",
    "svo0307_023": "In SAO, you were the final boss. The demon king, posing as an ally.",
    "svo0307_024": "You let the other strong players like Kirito be the heroes who would progress\r\nthrough the game...",
    "svo0307_025": "...while you watched from the sidelines.\r\nThat was who you were in SAO.",
    "svo0307_026": "If you really wanted to continue the game,\r\nyou would have done it in the same way.",
    "svo0307_027": "But now, you're trying too hard to understand the situation\r\nto move matters forward.",
    "svo0307_028": "That's why you can't be the source.",
    "svo0307_029": "An interesting point of view. In fact, you may be right.",
    "svo0307_030": "To add to your argument, SAO is over and done for me.\r\nIt showed me results far beyond my expectations.",
    "svo0307_031": "It was a story that only needed to be told once.",
    "svo0307_032": "Hmph. What proof do you have but your fancy words?",
    "svo0307_033": "If you ask me, you're the reason for all of this! Not only the one who\r\ncontaminated the minds of these three, but the one who caused the instability\r\nin the first place!",
    "svo0307_034": "Can you deny it?!",
    "svo0307_035": "Hmm. That is also a possibility.",
    "svo0307_036": "It WAS you! I knew it!",
    "svo0307_037": "However, you are too hasty.",
    "svo0307_038": "Rather than draw conclusions from the facts, you attempt to make the facts fit\r\nyour conclusions. Valuing your delusions over the reality before your own eyes\r\nis an unfortunate habit of yours.",
    "svo0307_039": "Don't you remember Professor Shigemura telling you that?\r\nYou never change, Sugou.",
    "svo0307_040": "Wha—!",
    "svo0307_041": "Now. As you can see, I am aware that Oberon is none other than Nobuyuki Sugou.",
    "svo0307_042": "Does that not prove that I am not trapped within my memories of SAO?",
    "svo0307_043": "It does. He didn't obtain that avatar until after the SAO Incident.",
    "svo0307_044": "I anticipated that it wasn't you, but...",
    "svo0307_045": "From the way you're talking, it sounds like your mind wasn't affected at all.\r\nWere you only playing along with me and Nautilus?",
    "svo0307_046": "That would be correct.\r\nI was never affected by this so-called cognitive contamination.",
    "svo0307_047": "Though I don't know if it was because I was confident in my sense of self\r\nor if my existence is simply unique.",
    "svo0307_048": "I see. So that's why you looked like you were enjoying it.",
    "svo0307_049": "I didn't pretend to be unaware out of malice.",
    "svo0307_050": "While I knew some abnormal phenomenon was occurring,\r\nI had no idea the cause or who was behind it.",
    "svo0307_051": "I had hoped to unravel that mystery.",
    "svo0307_052": "And in order to do that, I needed to determine precisely what was happening\r\nto you and what the situation was.",
    "svo0307_053": "That is why I simply observed you without intervening.",
    "svo0307_054": "Although, it would be a lie to say that I wasn't compelled by the promise of\r\nan unknown phenomenon.",
    "svo0307_055": "You're the one who came up with the FullDive tech in the first place, aren't\r\nyou? Are you saying this is something beyond even the system's creator?",
    "svo0307_056": "This world is out of my hands now. Even I can't predict how it will develop\r\nand evolve.",
    "svo0307_057": "Getting back to the subject at hand, I am neither the cause of this state\r\nof affairs, nor do I wish to return to SAO. That's all I have to say.",
    "svo0307_058": "Okay. Which means...",
    "svo0307_059": "There's only one other possibility.",
    "svo0307_060": "...",
    "svo0307_061": "I-I, uh, well...",
    "svo0307_062": "I couldn't really follow what you and the commander were talking about.",
    "svo0307_063": "But, uh, the boss is just up ahead, so why don't we take it out first?",
    "svo0307_064": "You really aren't aware of it, are you?",
    "svo0307_065": "There are indeed very few players who'd want to relive their time in SAO.",
    "svo0307_066": "However, if there was any such person, whether consciously or not...",
    "svo0307_067": "I'd think they'd be someone who wanted nothing more than to recover something\r\nthat world took from them.",
    "svo0307_068": "...",
    "svo0307_069": "Nautilus... No, Eiji.\r\nBack in Aincrad, you lost—",
    "svo0307_070": "Shut up!",
    "svo0307_071": "...",
    "svo0307_072": "Y-You and the commander aren't making any sense.",
    "svo0307_073": "Why are you two wasting time on all this stuff when the boss is right there?\r\nIt doesn't even matter! Are you scared?",
    "svo0307_074": "Fine, then I'll fight all by myself if I have to. I'm not scared.\r\nNot scared at all.",
    "svo0307_075": "I'm not helpless. I can fight!",
    "svo0307_076": "Wait, Eiji!",
    "svo0307_077": "Stop!",
    "svo0307_078": "There should be a boss in there! We need to chase—",
    "svo0307_079": "Grrrgh!",
    "svo0307_080": "Crap, it's here!\r\nHang on, isn't that the Skull Reaper?!",
    "svo0307_081": "What?! But why here?!\r\nIt's supposed to be the boss of Floor 75!",
    "svo0307_082": "Come on. Bring it!",
    "svo0307_083": "No, fall back!",
    "svo0307_084": "I'm not a coward!",
    "svo0307_084_2": "I can fight!",
    "svo0307_084_3": "I can—",
    "svo0307_085": "I can protect Yuna!",
    "svo0307_085_2": "I will!",
    "svo0307_086": "Ei!",
    "svo0307_087": "What? Yuna?",
    "svo0307_088": "Get up, Ei! You were gonna protect me, right?!",
    "svo0307_089": "I'll protect you in turn this time!",
    "svo0307_089_2": "We'll fight side-by-side!",
    "svo0307_090": "...",
    "svo0307_091": "Yuna!\r\nWh-What are you doing?",
    "svo0307_092": "...",
    "svo0307_093": "*gasp*",
    "svo0307_094": "...",
    "svo0307_095": "Nautilus. Real name, Eiji Nochizawa.",
    "svo0307_096": "You logged into SAO on its first day with your friend Yuna Shigemura,\r\nonly to get trapped like everyone else.",
    "svo0307_097": "You managed to survive all the way to the game's end and return to the real\r\nworld. Yuna was not so fortunate.",
    "svo0307_098": "...",
    "svo0307_099": "Yuna was...",
    "svo0307_100": "She was going to help with the battle strategy.\r\nShe was sure her Chant skill would do some good.",
    "svo0307_101": "But that dream was not to be.",
    "svo0307_102": "She went to go save me and the other players who'd triggered a trap,\r\nand she died in the process.",
    "svo0307_103": "I tried to protect her, but I froze up.\r\nThe same thing happened with the midboss on Floor 40.",
    "svo0307_104": "It was only later I learned I had FNC.\r\nThat is, FullDive Non-Conformity.",
    "svo0307_105": "Which was all linked to the AR idol Yuna and the Ordinal Scale incident.",
    "svo0307_106": "So you got your memories back?",
    "svo0307_107": "...",
    "svo0307_108": "Deep down, I've probably always wished I could go back to when Yuna was still\r\nalive and do things over.",
    "svo0307_109": "That wish created this world and sucked all of you into it.",
    "svo0307_110": "I suppose to some extent I'll always be living in the past.",
    "svo0307_111": "I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused you.",
    "svo0307_112": "That's appreciated, but I don't think anyone can blame you.",
    "svo0307_113": "...",
    "svo0307_114": "We're planning to regroup with everyone and search this world with them to\r\nfigure out what's going on.",
    "svo0307_115": "What about you? What're your plans?\r\nI'll admit, it'd be great to have you watching our backs.",
    "svo0307_116": "...",
    "svo0307_117": "I see. Well, if you don't want to, then I can't force you.",
    "svo0307_118": "Umm, I'm gonna stay here with Eiji.",
    "svo0307_119": "...!",
    "svo0307_120": "Then I guess this is goodbye?",
    "svo0307_121": "Aw, that's a shame. And we'd finally become friends too.",
    "svo0307_122": "I'm sorry. I think it's a shame too, but—",
    "svo0307_123": "Don't worry about me, Yuna. Do what you want to.",
    "svo0307_124": "I am. I want to stay with you.",
    "svo0307_125": "...!",
    "svo0307_126": "Say, Nautilus—I mean, Eiji.",
    "svo0307_127": "I doubt you care much for me, but let me say one last thing.",
    "svo0307_128": "All of us lost a lot in that incident.",
    "svo0307_129": "I'm not saying everyone's pain and sorrow are equal or can even really be\r\ncompared, of course.",
    "svo0307_130": "But at the very least, everyone was scarred.\r\nEveryone has scars that will never heal.",
    "svo0307_131": "...",
    "svo0307_132": "However, a lot's happened to us all in the time since.",
    "svo0307_133": "I believe we've all gained new things.\r\nAnd I think that probably goes for you too.",
    "svo0307_134": "Don't get me wrong, though.\r\nI'm not trying to say they can replace or make up for what was lost.",
    "svo0307_135": "But at least acknowledge that they mean something to you.\r\nThat may very well be what brings you peace someday.",
    "svo0307_136": "There, I've said my piece.\r\nBye.",
    "svo0307_137": "...",
    "svo0307_138": "And there they go. What do we do now?",
    "svo0307_139": "Eiji?",
    "svo0307_140": "...",
    "svo0307_141": "There're things I've gained.\r\nYeah, of course, she's right.",
    "svo0307_142": "Hmm?",
    "svo0307_143": "I've changed my mind.\r\nLet's go with them, Yuna.",
    "svo0307_144": "Okay. I'll be right there with you.",
    "svo0307_145": "So they have acquired four new comrades, have they?\r\nHmm, I'll have to check on them via Charlotte.",
    "svo0307_146": "Well done, Alice. You may return now.\r\nExercise caution.",
    "svo0307_147": "The search and acquisition of comrades is proceeding well.\r\nAll that is left is for my other collaborators to make progr—Hmm?",
    "svo0307_148": "Oh, speak of the devil, it's from them.\r\nLet's see what it is.",
    "svo0307_149": "Sender: \"Detective\"",

    "svo0401_002": "It's kinda unnerving how desolate it is.\r\nThink this is also supposed to be from some other game?",
    "svo0401_003": "Wait, I think this is Ordinal Scale.",
    "svo0401_004": "Y'know, where me and my Fuurinkazan squad were wiped out by Eiji.",
    "svo0401_005": "Oh, this is the map where that happened?",
    "svo0401_006": "Yep. It's not a total recreation like the other places,\r\nbut it sure looks the same.",
    "svo0401_007": "Ugh, seeing this brings back bad memories.\r\nLet's zoom right through this as fast as we—",
    "svo0401_008": "We can't, Klein. We've gotta find the Test Room.",
    "svo0401_009": "Yeah, trying to literally speedrun this place won't help.",
    "svo0401_010": "Point taken.",
    "svo0401_011": "I'm truly sorry for the discomfort this brings you.",
    "svo0401_012": "Nah, it's fine. Perfectly fine!\r\nI'm always the one getting the short end of the stick anyhow.",
    "svo0401_013": "Well, whaddya say we wipe out the monsters here before we start snooping around?",
    "svo0401_014": "Good luck to you all!",
    "svo0401_015": "Monsters eliminated!\r\nGood work, everyone!",
    "svo0401_016": "Thanks. Having you around really does get me into a fighting spirit.",
    "svo0401_017": "I'm happy I could be of help. I actually get to fight along with you all instead\r\nof just providing support this time.",
    "svo0401_018": "Yeah, I'll be counting on you.",
    "svo0401_019": "Heh! I won't let you down!",
    "svo0401_020": "Do we have to search all these ruins from top to bottom?",
    "svo0401_021": "I wouldn't go that far.\r\nJust a broad look around should be enough, I think.",
    "svo0401_022": "I'll be putting any bugs we see into a report.\r\nYou guys let me know if you notice anything off, okay?!",
    "svo0401_023": "It would be ideal if we could find the entrance to the Test Room or the\r\nSystem Console, though.",
    "svo0401_024": "I'm terribly sorry to bother all of you,\r\nbut it would be a great help if you were to assist us. Please.",
    "svo0401_025": "Okay, then let's get started. I know Fuuka and Neige will stick together,\r\nbut everyone needs to avoid going off on their own.",
    "svo0401_026": "We need to all stay in groups. Also, don't let your guard down.\r\nWe have no idea what could be waiting around any corner.",
    "svo0401_027": "Roger that!",
    "svo0401_028": "Got it. Then I'll guard Fuuka and Neige.",
    "svo0401_029": "Hmm? Something wrong, Eugeo?\r\nYou've been awfully quiet.",
    "svo0401_030": "No, it's nothing. Sorry.",
    "svo0401_031": "I'm just overwhelmed.\r\nI've never seen places like these before, and there's just more and more.",
    "svo0401_032": "Are all of these everyday sights in your world, Kirito?",
    "svo0401_033": "No, not really.\r\nWait, you realized I'm from a different world?",
    "svo0401_034": "I had a feeling.\r\nI'll admit I'm hurt you didn't tell me, but we can discuss it later.",
    "svo0401_035": "I'm also a bit surprised that the others aren't alarmed that our surroundings\r\nkeep changing.",
    "svo0401_036": "That's where you're wrong. We're pretty alarmed ourselves, believe me.\r\nIt's just―",
    "svo0401_037": "The existence of technology that fabricates worlds like these is something we\r\nall know about, so maybe we're quick to adapt.",
    "svo0401_038": "I see. I really am a Lost Child of Vecta here.\r\nIt is a very strange feeling.",
    "svo0401_039": "You're saying this is all fabricated.\r\nFrom the towering buildings that are lost to time, to the giant bridges and stone stairs.",
    "svo0401_040": "Hmph. It is hardly splendid compared to the Central Cathedral.",
    "svo0401_041": "Still, the concept of creating a world goes far beyond Underworld's idea\r\nof common practice.",
    "svo0401_042": "And that everyone knows and uses such a thing means advanced technology is the\r\nnorm for its people.",
    "svo0401_043": "I'd believed it most profitable for leaders to monopolize technology\r\nand knowledge, but does your world possess different values?",
    "svo0401_044": "Most people here think sharing those things leads to happiness for all.",
    "svo0401_045": "Also, information technology's developed so much that it's difficult to\r\nmonopolize new discoveries and the like without people finding out about them.",
    "svo0401_046": "Though there are still people who think like you do.\r\nPlus, there is indeed some information that's kept from the general public.",

    "svo0401_048": "Liz?\r\nWhat's wrong?",

    "svo0401_050": "What's the problem, Liz? What the...?",
    "svo0401_051": "Eep!",
    "svo0401_052": "Damn, this is brutal.",
    "svo0401_053": "Wh-What in the world is this?",
    "svo0401_054": "They've got \"DEAD\" signs above them, meaning these bodies must belong to\r\nplayers. One, two, three... There's over ten of them.",
    "svo0401_055": "L-Liz and I found them like this.\r\nWe were just randomly surveying the area when we stumbled across them.",
    "svo0401_056": "I thought I was gonna have a heart attack!",
    "svo0401_057": "They're all dead?\r\nWho would do such a thing?",
    "svo0401_058": "Calm down, Eugeo. This doesn't guarantee they're dead.\r\nThe definition of death varies depending on the world over here.",
    "svo0401_059": "H-He's right.\r\nThis is a VR world, so they aren't really dead, probably.",
    "svo0401_060": "Besides, they might come back to life like nothing happened once this\r\nabnormality subsides.",
    "svo0401_061": "Still, we shouldn't ignore this either.\r\nCould you look into it, Yui?",
    "svo0401_062": "You've got it, Daddy.",
    "svo0401_063": "It appears the damage they took was accurately reproduced on their avatars.\r\nFrom what I can tell, these are slash and puncture wounds.",
    "svo0401_064": "Ugh, there may not be any blood, but seeing all these bodies still makes me\r\nkinda sick.",
    "svo0401_065": "Can you tell anything about what kinds of weapons were used\r\nor when they were killed?",
    "svo0401_066": "No. This is the best I can do with my functions heavily limited as they are\r\nat the moment. I'm so sorry, Daddy.",
    "svo0401_067": "Oh, that's too bad. But it's okay, Yui.\r\nIt's not your fault.",
    "svo0401_068": "Goddamn did they kill a lotta people, though.\r\nWhoever did this must've been as tough as one big bad boss.",
    "svo0401_069": "Ya think? Looks to me like they couldn't have been that big.\r\nBased on the size of their wounds and all, I mean.",
    "svo0401_070": "No matter how brutal their weapon of choice was,\r\nthey would've had to be human-sized, wouldn't they?",
    "svo0401_071": "Th-Then they were done in by a swarm of little monsters!\r\nThey got surrounded and couldn't fight back.",
    "svo0401_072": "Take a closer look, would you?\r\nThey have each suffered clean fatal wounds, have they not?",
    "svo0401_073": "She's right. If they were killed by a horde, they probably would have been\r\ncovered in cuts from head to toe.",
    "svo0401_074": "Whatcher saying is that these people got steamrolled by a small group of\r\nregular-sized monsters?",
    "svo0401_075": "Hmm. Maybe this was a group of super elite monsters or something?",
    "svo0401_076": "But none of the beasts we exterminated just now were all that impressive.",
    "svo0401_077": "Though I can't deny the chance that they are still hiding nearby.",
    "svo0401_078": "What other possibilities could we be dealing with?",
    "svo0401_079": "PKs, maybe? Like, they were pretending to be buddies with these guys\r\nand struck when their guard was down? Or something?",
    "svo0401_080": "Oh right, didn't you and the others hear something like that, Leafa?",
    "svo0401_081": "Yeah, the ones we mistook Fuuka and Neige for. I'd rather not go down that road again.",
    "svo0401_082": "Hey, I'm really sorry for what I did back there.",
    "svo0401_083": "I-It's all right, don't let it bother you.\r\nThe whole thing is water under the bridge now.",
    "svo0401_084": "Still, it sure does skeeve me out to think a bunch of creeps like Laughing Coffin\r\ncould be running around in this world.",
    "svo0401_085": "Ugh, can we talk about something else?",
    "svo0401_086": "Is it really such a call for panic?",
    "svo0401_087": "If anything attacks, we merely have to stave them off,\r\nwhether they be monster or bloodthirsty human.",
    "svo0401_088": "We can't all see things as black and white as you.",
    "svo0401_089": "...",
    "svo0401_090": "(Yeah, he's right.)",
    "svo0401_091": "(Anyone would be shaken up after seeing that many bodies under these\r\ncircumstances, VR or not. It unsettles me too.)",
    "svo0401_092": "(That's not to say I can't understand why Administrator's so calm, but still.)",
    "svo0401_093": "(But why is—)",
    "svo0401_094": "Huh? Hey guys, where'd Fuuka go?",
    "svo0401_095": "Huh? Oh hey, that's weird, she was just here.\r\nGot any ideas, Neige?",
    "svo0401_096": "I only just noticed she was gone myself.\r\nWhere could she be?",
    "svo0401_097": "Isn't it dangerous for her to be wanderin' off on her own given what's going on?",
    "svo0401_098": "Maybe we should go look for her.",
    "svo0401_099": "Hey, Fuuka left on her own, right?",
    "svo0401_100": "Well yeah, how else would she have disappeared?",
    "svo0401_101": "With the bodies and everything else we just didn't notice her leave, yeah?",
    "svo0401_102": "I could understand if she'd been snatched by an enemy,\r\nbut what's the deal with her up and leaving?",
    "svo0401_103": "...",
    "svo0401_104": "(That's right, Fuuka didn't look surprised by the bodies.\r\nIn fact, she was calm to an unsettling degree.)",
    "svo0401_105": "(Am I just overthinking this?)",
    "svo0401_106": "(Actually, come to think of it, she's gone off on her own several times\r\nsince teaming up with us. She says she's scouting, but is that really true?)",
    "svo0401_107": "Stop, what am I even thinking?\r\nIt's not like there's any proof.",
    "svo0401_108": "Daddy?",
    "svo0401_109": "It's nothing. Anyway, you're right. It's too dangerous for her to be alone.\r\nLet's split up and search.",
    "svo0402_001": "Good work, everyone.\r\nI am truly pleased to have more comrades.",
    "svo0402_002": "...",
    "svo0402_003": "Wh-What is it?",
    "svo0402_004": "Hmm. So it's possible for a personality and a system program to merge, is it?",
    "svo0402_005": "I did indeed program it to be able to operate autonomously for an extended\r\nperiod of time. But to think a character could change and mature in such a\r\nmatter is fascinating.",
    "svo0402_006": "Hmph, do you fancy yourself a god, Kayaba?",
    "svo0402_007": "Hardly. Though I would be lying were I to claim this revelation did not stir\r\nsomething in my soul.",
    "svo0402_008": "Ah, pardon my manners. You are Cardinal, yes? My name is Heathcliff.\r\nAlice has given me an outline on what is happening.",
    "svo0402_009": "I believe we can be of assistance in clarifying and settling this matter.",
    "svo0402_010": "Sp-Splendid, your aid would be much appreciated.",
    "svo0402_011": "First, let us review our current situation.\r\nSome new information has just come to light.",
    "svo0402_012": "That is the Test Room used for debugging the Galaxia system?",
    "svo0402_013": "I see. If we access the system from there,\r\nwe may be able to obtain a more detailed picture regarding the abnormalities.",
    "svo0402_014": "And you're telling us that the staff was killed? But by who?\r\nAnd why?",
    "svo0402_015": "Heh. Who says they needed a reason?\r\nSometimes, the thrill is the reason.",
    "svo0402_016": "Point taken.",
    "svo0402_017": "Still, it's amazing someone was able to find the Test Room and obtain this\r\ninformation, given the situation.",
    "svo0402_018": "So, um, what's this person like?",
    "svo0402_019": "They call themselves a detective.",
    "svo0402_020": "D-Did you say detective?\r\nIsn't that just a thing in movies?",
    "svo0402_021": "Supposedly they had some sort of agreement with Galaxia's developer.",
    "svo0402_022": "The Detective makes a living investigating trends in VR worlds, analyzing them,\r\nand providing advice. They have been aiding the developers under contract since\r\nbefore launch.",
    "svo0402_023": "Essentially, they're a consultant.\r\nWe had people like that on the Ordinal Scale staff too.",
    "svo0402_024": "Oh yeah, the people who gave input on my design and graphics, right?",
    "svo0402_025": "The Detective was the first one Lady Cardinal and I met\r\nafter we were sent to this world.",
    "svo0402_026": "They have a breadth of knowledge about VR worlds and are skilled\r\nin information gathering. It seemed natural that we enlist their aid.",
    "svo0402_027": "I'm sure a time will come where we can introduce you all.\r\nBut that shall have to wait. Now is the time where you must act.",
    "svo0402_028": "You want us to perform a field survey on what the Detective found, don't you?",
    "svo0402_029": "Indeed. The Galaxia system merits investigation.\r\nPerhaps a search will yield something.",
    "svo0402_030": "As such, your next destination is the Test Room, and I shall be going with you.\r\nWould you do me the service of protecting me?",
    "svo0402_031": "Huh? You will be accompanying us, Lady Cardinal?\r\nBut isn't it a bit dangerous?",
    "svo0402_032": "I lack the capacity to battle in my current state, and it is unlikely I shall be safe.\r\nBut is there any truly safe place in this predicament?",
    "svo0402_033": "And since it will be difficult to access the system externally,\r\nI must go to the Test Room myself to investigate it.",
    "svo0402_034": "Still...",
    "svo0402_035": "Don't worry! She's got all the bodyguards she'll ever need!\r\nWe'll all keep her safe!",
    "svo0402_036": "Very well. Then let us sally forth.",
    "svo0402_037": "Splendid. My eternal thanks.",
    "svo0402_038": "The place is supposed to be around here, right?",
    "svo0402_039": "Yeah. Kind of anticlimactic how easily we made it over, huh?",
    "svo0402_040": "Mmm, I dunno if I should be grateful or disappointed Rightony and Leftania didn't\r\nget a chance to shine.",
    "svo0402_041": "The less danger, the better. Is this detective friend of yours nearby?",
    "svo0402_042": "No, they merely agreed to assist me when it benefited us both.\r\nApparently, they have their own objective, and finding them may prove difficult.",
    "svo0402_043": "That said, we must be grateful to them for clearing the path to the Test Room.\r\nSpeaking of which...",
    "svo0402_044": "I'll just input an ID and password into this System Console,\r\nand that should do it.",
    "svo0402_045": "Whoa, a door appeared out of thin air!\r\nDoes it go to the Test Room?",
    "svo0402_046": "I don't hear anything behind the door, nor do I sense anyone.",
    "svo0402_047": "Still, stay on guard.",
    "svo0402_048": "We should go about this as per normal exploration tactics.\r\nThose armored and specializing in close-range combat, take the front.",
    "svo0402_049": "Everyone else, stick to the rear.\r\nProtect Cardinal and watch our backs.",
    "svo0402_050": "Ready? I'm going to input the open door command.",
    "svo0402_051": "...",
    "svo0402_052": "L-Looks like the coast is clear.",
    "svo0402_053": "Proceed inside, vanguard.\r\nRearguard, follow us once we've secured the area.",
    "svo0402_054": "By the Goddess Stacia...",
    "svo0402_055": "Hmm. Dead, huh? Looks like there's been another massacre.",
    "svo0402_056": "I would have been surprised if we hadn't known about this in advance.\r\nStill, that doesn't make it any easier to stomach.",
    "svo0402_057": "Come to think of it, you haven't come across anything like this since this whole\r\nthing started, have you, Asuna?",
    "svo0402_058": "What?\r\nYou mean dead bodies?",
    "svo0402_059": "Yeah.\r\nSee, we actually bumped into some murdered players before we found Cardinal.",
    "svo0402_060": "Doesn't this remind you of that, Alice? Sinon?",
    "svo0402_061": "How true. The similarities are uncanny.",
    "svo0402_062": "It seems like these guys were killed by something human-sized,\r\njust like those other players.",
    "svo0402_063": "Supposedly a girl, a tester who was helping them, went missing, right?",
    "svo0402_064": "This really was the work of a PKer, then?\r\nAnd she's the culprit?",
    "svo0402_065": "Let's not jump to conclusions, here.\r\nFor all we know, they could have let a monster in.",
    "svo0402_066": "Those are all questions we should consider as we proceed.\r\nThe fact they have logs remaining means we may find our answers.",
    "svo0402_067": "Now are any of you VR technicians or programmers?",
    "svo0402_068": "My knowledge is somewhat specialized,\r\nand I will need assistance with parsing the system logs and data.",
    "svo0402_069": "Oh? All eyes seem to be on you. Heathcliff, was it?\r\nDo you possess such know-how?",
    "svo0402_070": "More or less. I'll help if you'll have me. What about you, Sugou—\r\nI mean, Oberon?",
    "svo0402_071": "I'll do what I can.\r\nI'd take this any day over being forced to fight monsters.",
    "svo0402_072": "Can we help too? Yuna should be able to provide support,\r\nwhile I can at least do whatever odd jobs you've got.",
    "svo0402_073": "He's right! Let me help!",
    "svo0402_074": "I am grateful for the offer, but is working alongside me truly acceptable?",
    "svo0402_075": "I'd be lying if I said I didn't have mixed feelings.\r\nBut I've made up my mind to move forward rather than fall behind.",
    "svo0402_076": "In that case, we'll take a break while keeping watch in shifts.",
    "svo0402_077": "Roger!",
    "svo0402_078": "How's it look out there?",
    "svo0402_079": "Nothing out of the ordinary. No monsters either, for now.",
    "svo0402_080": "Want me to take over?\r\nIt sounds like they're going to be working in there for a while.",
    "svo0402_081": "Nah, I'm cool.\r\nNot like I'm smart enough to do much more than keep watch right now, anyway.",
    "svo0402_082": "Hey, don't put yourself down.\r\nWe're all dummies compared to them.",
    "svo0402_083": "By the way, you holding up okay, Asuna?\r\nYour memories aren't still fuzzy, are they?",
    "svo0402_084": "Nope, I'm all good!",
    "svo0402_085": "Sorry, I've been trying to put on a brave face.\r\nHonestly, I'm still kinda scared.",
    "svo0402_086": "Of what?",
    "svo0402_087": "The fact my brain went all funny means I'm no longer sure if what I'm seeing\r\nand feeling right now is even real.",
    "svo0402_088": "Like...",
    "svo0402_089": "Like how I can't tell if you're really here or just an illusion.",
    "svo0402_090": "Yuuki, you're...",
    "svo0402_091": "You're...",
    "svo0402_092": "I'm just happy I get this time to talk to you.",
    "svo0402_093": "Since I have such feelings, it doesn't matter if I'm an illusion.\r\nIt's all real to me.",
    "svo0402_094": "Or is that not good enough?",
    "svo0402_095": "...",
    "svo0402_096": "No, you're right.",
    "svo0402_097": "Hmm?",
    "svo0402_098": "Something wrong?",
    "svo0402_099": "I just saw someone off in the distance. A girl, maybe?",
    "svo0402_100": "*gasp*\r\nAsuna! Behind you!",
    "svo0402_101": "Monsters?!",
    "svo0402_102": "They just keep coming!",
    "svo0402_103": "Gah! Is there no end to them?!",
    "svo0402_104": "Anyone who's not busy needs to get here now!\r\nDefend the Test Room with your lives!",
    "svo0402_105": "Oh, Alice.\r\nI hope things didn't escalate too badly.",
    "svo0402_106": "Not at all. Everyone is all right. We managed to rout the enemy.",
    "svo0402_107": "However, Asuna and Yuuki said they saw a suspicious individual along with the\r\nmonsters and are currently in pursuit.",
    "svo0402_108": "Mmm, that concerns me. Is it not dangerous to let them go on their own?",
    "svo0402_109": "I share your sentiment, but we cannot afford to weaken our defenses.\r\nThey're clever. They would not dare engage in any reckless stunts.",
    "svo0402_110": "I suppose we can do little more than have faith in them.\r\nOn another note, there sure was a heap of monsters.",
    "svo0402_111": "Indeed. This is the first time I have seen a horde this massive since arriving\r\nin this world.",
    "svo0402_112": "It seems they planned to rush us all at once as soon as they found us.\r\nAnd if that's the case―",
    "svo0402_113": "Yes. It's too well-planned. It's almost as if they have someone leading them.\r\nCould they not want us investigating the Test Room for some reason?",
    "svo0402_114": "Do you think it could be that missing tester the Detective informed you of?",
    "svo0402_115": "Her name was Fuuka, if memory serves me right.",
    "svo0402_116": "It's too early to say for sure.\r\nWe need more information.",
    "svo0402_117": "Speaking of which, how has the investigation of this room fared?\r\nHave you discovered anything?",
    "svo0402_118": "Well, we retrieved as much data as we could before we began any sort of\r\nanalysis.",
    "svo0402_119": "None of it proved insightful, though.",
    "svo0402_120": "...",
    "svo0402_121": "...",
    "svo0402_122": "...",
    "svo0402_123": "Unfortunately, the one responsible for this got us good.\r\nThe majority of the system was locked just a few minutes ago.",
    "svo0402_124": "What do you mean?",
    "svo0402_125": "We have been prohibited from performing numerous operations,\r\nincluding perusing the logs and rebooting the Galaxia system.",
    "svo0402_126": "Now we've got no way to fully inspect the Test Room.",
    "svo0403_001": "It seems that System Console we used to open the door is executing the system\r\nlockdown command.",
    "svo0403_002": "They operated it and sealed away the data while everyone was distracted fighting\r\nthe monsters.",
    "svo0403_003": "What you're saying is, we have nothing?",
    "svo0403_004": "I wouldn't go that far.",
    "svo0403_005": "We managed to retrieve some data prior to the system lockdown.\r\nWe'll review that now.",
    "svo0403_006": "However, this is ultimately a failure in terms of our initial goal to perform\r\na thorough investigation.",
    "svo0403_007": "Curses! How infuriating!\r\nCan you really do nothing, Kayaba?",
    "svo0403_008": "I have no admin privileges here.\r\nI can test out a number of countermeasures, but don't bank your hopes on them.",
    "svo0403_009": "Much as I'd like to hope Asuna and Yuuki can catch the one responsible for this,\r\nthere's no guarantee.",
    "svo0403_010": "Stop right there!",
    "svo0403_010_2": "Yaaah!",
    "svo0403_011": "...!",
    "svo0403_012": "Whoa there!",
    "svo0403_013": "No way! How'd you react that fast?",
    "svo0403_014": "You're not half bad yourself the way you gave us the slip.",
    "svo0403_015": "What's your name?",
    "svo0403_016": "...",
    "svo0403_017": "You're the one who fiddled with the console outside the Test Room, aren't you?\r\nWhy did you do that?",
    "svo0403_018": "...",
    "svo0403_019": "Hey, can't you give us at least something?\r\nI think that'll be to all our benefit.",
    "svo0403_020": "Keep your silence at your own peril.\r\nWe can't afford to be too forgiving with things as they are.",
    "svo0403_021": "You were part of the Test Room's staff, weren't you?\r\nDo you know what happened there?",
    "svo0403_022": "...\r\nHee hee!",
    "svo0403_023": "Well, well. So you saw it.",
    "svo0403_024": "All that's in there are a few collapsed avatars, but the whole thing felt real,\r\ndidn't it?",
    "svo0403_024_2": "You should be thanking me.",
    "svo0403_025": "Good lord. That means the one who killed them was—",
    "svo0403_026": "Yes, it was me!",
    "svo0403_027": "Huh?",
    "svo0403_028": "M-Monsters?! Hey, where are you going?!",
    "svo0403_029": "What's the meaning of all this? She was the killer?",
    "svo0403_030": "That's what she said, but we've got bigger problems now!",
    "svo0403_031": "Gwoghhhhh!",
    "svo0403_032": "We've gotta do something about these guys!",
    "svo0403_033": "Hang on, guys! I'm almost there!",
    "svo0403_034": "Phew, made it just in time.",
    "svo0403_035": "Kirito!",
    "svo0403_036": "You okay, Asuna?",
    "svo0403_037": "Yeah. Thanks.",
    "svo0403_038": "What's wrong?",
    "svo0403_039": "Sorry, it's nothing. I'm just relieved to see you.",
    "svo0403_040": "A lot's happened, but I'm glad we found each other.",
    "svo0403_041": "Me too.",
    "svo0403_042": "Oh, get a room, you two!",
    "svo0403_043": "Look, it's great and all that you two are happy together, but seriously...",
    "svo0403_044": "Yeah, there's a time and place for flirting! Let me think.\r\nY'know, maybe in private, hm?",
    "svo0403_045": "U-Uh, so, um, you all came to help, huh?",
    "svo0403_046": "That's right, Mommy! Are you hurt?\r\nYou weren't seriously harmed, were you?",
    "svo0403_047": "No, I'm all right. Thanks for worrying, Yui.",
    "svo0403_048": "Is that all of them?\r\nThere aren't more beasts waiting to ambush us, are there?",
    "svo0403_049": "Nope, that should be it. Thanks for the assist!",
    "svo0403_050": "But what brings you all here anyway?",
    "svo0403_051": "It's a long story. I'll explain later.\r\nAre you two by yourselves?",
    "svo0403_052": "No, there's a lot more.\r\nYuuki and I just split from them to go after a suspicious person.",
    "svo0403_053": "We'll take you to the others.\r\nFollow me.",
    "svo0403_054": "Fuka!",
    "svo0403_055": "LLENN! There you are! I missed you!",
    "svo0403_056": "Well, if it isn't Sinon and Silica.\r\nHey there! You guys holding up okay?",
    "svo0403_057": "Liz! Leafa!",
    "svo0403_058": "Whew, it feels good to have the gang back together!",
    "svo0403_059": "I don't know why, but it feels like it's been an eternity since we were last\r\ntogether.",
    "svo0403_060": "Man, you really brought a whole crowd over, eh Kirito?",
    "svo0403_061": "Our party's gotten quite big all of a sudden.",
    "svo0403_062": "Hey, the more the merrier, right?!",
    "svo0403_063": "I suspected you had been brought to this world, Kirito.\r\nIt warms my heart to see you're safe.",
    "svo0403_064": "Not that I expected you to do anything foolhardy, mind you.",
    "svo0403_065": "Also, it's been a long time, hasn't it, Eugeo?",
    "svo0403_066": "Alice? So you got mixed up in all this too.",
    "svo0403_067": "Then again, I guess it's no surprise, seeing as how Kirito and Administrator are\r\nhere as well.",
    "svo0403_068": "In any case, I'm just glad we all found each other.\r\nStill...",
    "svo0403_069": "...",
    "svo0403_070": "You look as if you have something you wish to say, little one.",
    "svo0403_071": "Naturally. It would not surprise me if you were the one responsible for this\r\nstate of affairs.",
    "svo0403_072": "Oh my! You wound me. I'm just as much a victim here as the rest of you.",
    "svo0403_073": "It seems there are some old relationships among you that still complicate\r\nthings.",
    "svo0403_074": "Indeed.",
    "svo0403_075": "Oh great, it's Heathcliff.",
    "svo0403_076": "But would you not agree the same goes for your group, Kirito?\r\nYour party appears to be a conglomerate of connected individuals.",
    "svo0403_077": "...",
    "svo0403_078": "...",
    "svo0403_079": "...",
    "svo0403_080": "Hi there, Kirito!",
    "svo0403_081": "H-Heya, Yuna.",
    "svo0403_082": "You're here too, huh? Good to see you.",
    "svo0403_083": "A-Ahahaha.",
    "svo0403_084": "Hey, Kirito.\r\nTake a step back from her, would you?",
    "svo0403_085": "Oh dear.",
    "svo0403_086": "Well, we've all got our own little personal grudges and whatnot.",
    "svo0403_087": "But let's shelve those for now.\r\nWe've got bigger fish to fry.",
    "svo0403_088": "Isn't that right, Cardinal?",
    "svo0403_089": "Mmm. Precisely.",
    "svo0403_090": "Kirito, you and your party come right this way.\r\nWe should share information while the others celebrate this reunion.",
    "svo0403_091": "Yeah. That description of Fuuka you just gave lines up perfectly with the girl \r\nwe saw.",
    "svo0403_092": "U-Umm, you're saying Fuuka came here and locked everyone out of the system?",
    "svo0403_093": "And she claimed to be the PKer who wiped out the staff and ran away?\r\nYou've gotta be kidding me.",
    "svo0403_094": "...",
    "svo0403_095": "H-Hold on a sec.",
    "svo0403_096": "If that's true, then that means Fuuka killed the staff here\r\nand caused the system to go haywire.",
    "svo0403_097": "And all that before she ever met up with us, right?",
    "svo0403_098": "The room's entry logs lend high credibility to that theory, yes.",
    "svo0403_099": "We don't have definitive proof yet, though.\r\nIt's just a working theory.",
    "svo0403_100": "No, it can't be Fuuka...",
    "svo0403_101": "B-But that doesn't add up.",
    "svo0403_102": "I mean, wasn't she the one who asked you guys to take her to the Test Room?",
    "svo0403_103": "Why would she bring people back to the scene of her crime?",
    "svo0403_104": "No, that's not quite right.\r\nWhat actually happened was...",
    "svo0403_105": "But anyway, that's why I'm hoping I can ask you guys a favor.\r\nThink you could be my muscle?",
    "svo0403_106": "Yes, she's right.\r\nIt would indeed be reassuring to have you escorting us on the way over.",
    "svo0403_107": "Sounds like you've got a destination in mind.",
    "svo0403_108": "I believe it would be for the best if we were to return to the Test Room.\r\nDon't you agree, Fuuka?",
    "svo0403_109": "Right, it was Neige, not Fuuka, who suggested returning to the Test Room.",
    "svo0403_110": "Fuuka didn't want to go, but couldn't risk saying that in front of Neige without\r\nlooking suspicious, maybe?",
    "svo0403_111": "If that's the case, was she trying to lure us away from the Test Room\r\nwhile we were exploring together?\r\nI do remember her scouting ahead often to find us a path.",
    "svo0403_112": "And if Fuuka was the one behind the massacre in the Test Room...",
    "svo0403_113": "...then maybe Leafa and the others' suspicions that she was a PKer\r\nweren't just a misunderstanding.",
    "svo0403_114": "How can you be so calm, Kirito?!",
    "svo0403_115": "I'm not. I just―",
    "svo0403_116": "You suspect there is something up with her, I take it?",
    "svo0403_117": "Basically, yeah. Something's bugging me.",
    "svo0403_118": "I'm not going to blindly assume she's the culprit,\r\nbut claiming she is and disappearing doesn't exactly help her case...",
    "svo0403_119": "True. I'd like to hear what she has to say first, if we can.",
    "svo0403_120": "At any rate, Neige, was it?\r\nYou were in charge of development support in this Test Room, correct?",
    "svo0403_121": "Why yes, I was.",
    "svo0403_122": "Am I right to assume you had no inkling of this Fuuka's actions and intentions?",
    "svo0403_123": "N-No, of course I didn't!",
    "svo0403_124": "Hmm. Then allow me to ask you something with that in mind.\r\nCan you unlock the Test Room?",
    "svo0403_125": "My apologies, but I believe that would be quite impossible.\r\nNot while I am currently bereaved of all my authority over Galaxia.",
    "svo0403_126": "I see.\r\nIn that case, I would like to ask you how this all came to pass.",
    "svo0403_127": "Could you tell us all that you know starting from the beginning of this\r\ncrisis―start to finish?",
    "svo0403_128": "Very well.",
    "svo0403_129": "But there isn't much to tell, you know. When I came to, Fuuka and I had\r\nalready been transported to a map we didn't recognize.",
    "svo0403_130": "We wandered around with no idea of what was happening when Fuuka was accosted\r\nby other players. That's when Kirito and Quinella stepped in to save—",
    "svo0403_131": "Hold it.",
    "svo0403_132": "Huh?",
    "svo0403_133": "Do you not detect the oddity in the tale you just regaled us with?",
    "svo0403_134": "H-Huh? No.",
    "svo0403_135": "Neige, Heathcliff just asked you to explain everything you knew about this\r\ncrisis from start to finish, right?",
    "svo0403_136": "And currently, we suspect that Fuuka caused Galaxia to go haywire after\r\nmurdering the staff.",
    "svo0403_137": "C-Correct.",
    "svo0403_138": "But Fuuka told us the forced teleportation occurred after the system went\r\nhaywire.",
    "svo0403_139": "Why, yes. But what of it?",
    "svo0403_140": "You still don't get it? What we're saying is you've left a part out.",
    "svo0403_141": "Why is it that you perceive the part where you were teleported against your will\r\nas the start of the crisis?",
    "svo0403_142": "You left out everything that you and Fuuka were doing before,\r\nwhen tragedy struck in the Test Room.",
    "svo0403_143": "Don't you think that's unnatural?",
    "svo0403_144": "Wait, huh?",
    "svo0403_145": "No, I remember.\r\nI-I should remember.",
    "svo0403_146": "Fuuka became my friend after she started working as a tester.\r\nShe could never have been so cruel as to massacre the staff.",
    "svo0403_147": "But what did she do just before the forced teleportation?\r\nI-I can't remember!",
    "svo0403_148": "Calm down, Neige. Don't rush.",
    "svo0403_149": "...",
    "svo0403_150": "You're missing your memories of what happened in the Test Room, right?\r\nAnd you hadn't noticed that up until now?",
    "svo0403_151": "Correct.",
    "svo0403_152": "Hmm, it would seem this is different from the incidental memory loss—\r\nthe \"cognitive contamination\"—that befell Asuna and Nautilus.",
    "svo0403_153": "A specified range of Neige's memories were deleted. It would be prudent to\r\nassume this was the work of someone with a degree of authority.",
    "svo0403_154": "Huh? I, uh, I'm not following.",
    "svo0403_155": "He is saying that her memories and mind were tampered with—\r\nLikely by this Fuuka.",
    "svo0404_001": "...",
    "svo0404_002": "I see. That's why Neige seems so down.",
    "svo0404_003": "She must feel like her own buddy stabbed her in the back.\r\nAll we can really do is let her work it out on her own.\r\nThere is one thing, though.",
    "svo0404_004": "Hey Leafa, are you sure Fuuka did all that?",
    "svo0404_005": "Well, it doesn't sound like they've got proof.",
    "svo0404_006": "But there's apparently no other suspects besides Fuuka.",
    "svo0404_007": "What was this Fuuka like?\r\nWas she the scary sort who seemed capable of something like that?",
    "svo0404_008": "Mmm, no, she was actually a chipper chatterbox.\r\nI never would have thought her the type.",
    "svo0404_009": "Though that's just me talking. I could be mistaken.\r\nDo you think I misjudged?",
    "svo0404_010": "Not at all. I had the same impression.\r\nBut there's a pretty good chance she was hiding something from us, isn't there?",
    "svo0404_011": "She was at least lying about not being able to fight.\r\nThere's no doubt about that after she took on Asuna and Yuuki and escaped.",
    "svo0404_012": "Perhaps she's in some sort of situation where she can't explain her own actions.",
    "svo0404_013": "At any rate, what do we do now? Go after her?",
    "svo0404_014": "That's what Kirito and the others are discussing now.",
    "svo0404_015": "They're trying to decide whether to prioritize finding Fuuka\r\nor securing the Test Room and finding a way to unlock the system.",
    "svo0404_016": "Then it's settled.\r\nWe'll all go after Fuuka.",
    "svo0404_017": "Hey there, Kiridude.",
    "svo0404_018": "We're going to form a search party of four to five people.\r\nYou're welcome to join if you'd like.",
    "svo0404_019": "I'm on board with that, but are you sure it's impossible to unlock the system?",
    "svo0404_020": "According to the others, we'll need Fuuka to break the lock.",
    "svo0404_021": "So it requires biometric authentication?\r\nLike fingerprints?",
    "svo0404_022": "There's more to biometrics than that.\r\nThere're finger vein patterns and retinal scans, apparently.",
    "svo0404_023": "Oh, and some use facial recognition, voice recognition, or handwriting.\r\nBasically, something only the user could do.",
    "svo0404_024": "The upside to such a system is it is far more difficult to crack\r\nthan the passwords of yore.",
    "svo0404_025": "But on the downside, it renders services designed with sharing in mind futile,\r\nsince only the original user can access it.",
    "svo0404_026": "In this case, the Test Room's systems are locked by Fuuka Natsuyagi's\r\nvoice print and brain wave patterns.",
    "svo0404_027": "Put simply, she is the only one who can unlock it.",
    "svo0404_028": "Just to be safe, there ain't a way to neutralize the authentication system\r\nitself, is there?",
    "svo0404_029": "No. Brute forcing it is impossible. We require admin privileges.\r\nThe system is quite complex.",
    "svo0404_030": "Not only does the Test Room run the Galaxia system, it does this by making free\r\nreign of unknown technology, fascinatingly enough.",
    "svo0404_031": "It boasts terrifyingly solid security that cannot be measured by the standards\r\nof modern science. Thus, it is difficult to conceive a way to penetrate it\r\nusing pre-existing technology.",
    "svo0404_032": "Unknown even to you?",
    "svo0404_033": "That's some real hardcore stuff we're dealin' with then, ain't it?",
    "svo0404_034": "Why do you say that? Is this guy some sort of big shot superhuman?",
    "svo0404_035": "Hardly. I'd say I am more a dreamer than a human.",
    "svo0404_036": "In any case, you must restore the Galaxia system\r\nto return to your original world, and we'll need Fuuka for that.",
    "svo0404_037": "And there you have it.\r\nMeaning we haven't any time to tarry.",
    "svo0404_038": "Oh.\r\nMonsters.",
    "svo0404_039": "And it looks like they brought the whole family!",
    "svo0404_040": "They'll be on us faster than expected.\r\nThere shouldn't have been that many monsters this way.",
    "svo0404_041": "Perhaps this is her parting gift intended to divert our pursuit.\r\nNow then, Asuna, tell me, what do you believe we should do?",
    "svo0404_042": "Let's group together and break through their ranks!",
    "svo0404_043": "The monsters have stopped attacking.\r\nIt seems you've done them in.",
    "svo0404_044": "Whew.\r\nGood work, guys.",
    "svo0404_045": "Did Fuuka send these beasts to slow us down?\r\nCould that be true?",
    "svo0404_046": "Yeah, it's looking more and more likely that she's got admin privileges\r\nand is at the heart of this incident.",
    "svo0404_047": "We must first locate her and discern her motives.",
    "svo0404_048": "But we've never met this Fuuka.\r\nCan she be reasoned with?",
    "svo0404_049": "I'm not sure.",
    "svo0404_050": "We don't even have an idea what she wanted to do or what she was trying to do.\r\nShe left no clues as to her motives.",
    "svo0404_051": "There's no point in negotiating when you don't know what the other side wants.",
    "svo0404_052": "True enough.",
    "svo0404_053": "You were close to Fuuka, weren't you, Neige?\r\nWhat sort of person is she?",
    "svo0404_054": "What exactly do you mean?",
    "svo0404_055": "She's asking what your impression of Fuuka was,\r\nsince you'd probably know better than anyone else.",
    "svo0404_056": "Umm, well, she's cheerful and always thinks positive.\r\nI admired her for having what I didn't.",
    "svo0404_057": "We were an AI and a human, yet I think we got along well.\r\nThough perhaps I had the wrong idea this whole time.",
    "svo0404_058": "Neige.",
    "svo0404_059": "D-Don't be sad! I'm sure she must have her reasons!",
    "svo0404_060": "Even if she does, I no longer have any idea what she's thinking,\r\nnor why she did all this.",
    "svo0404_061": "Heh heh heh.",
    "svo0404_062": "People kill others. There's no reason. None except hatred.\r\nAnd the thrill.",
    "svo0404_063": "We still don't know if Fuuka PK'd them.\r\nThat's why we're trying to get her side of the story.",
    "svo0404_064": "How soft. You must have resolve to kill.\r\nEspecially, against a killer.",
    "svo0404_065": "Look, that won't solve anything.",
    "svo0404_066": "We need Fuuka's help to break the lock on the Test Room.\r\nOtherwise, we'll never get any closer to putting an end to this.",
    "svo0404_067": "And if that happens, the world will never return to normal.",
    "svo0404_068": "Is that a problem?",
    "svo0404_069": "Huh?",
    "svo0404_070": "You have eyes for seeing.\r\nEars for hearing.",
    "svo0404_071": "Feet to tread the earth.\r\nArms to carry weapons.",
    "svo0404_072": "What more do you need?",
    "svo0404_073": "I have wondered.\r\nMaybe it's better, if this world were the real one.",
    "svo0404_074": "See, killing is simple here.",
    "svo0404_075": "I sense Fuuka is as I am.",
    "svo0404_076": "Heh. Heh heh. I wonder, did she create this world to kill?\r\nTo kill to her heart's content?",
    "svo0404_077": "N-No! That's not true! She's not―\r\nShe's not like that.",
    "svo0404_078": "Then tell me, what is she like?",
    "svo0404_079": "Didn't you say, you couldn't tell what she's thinking?",
    "svo0404_080": "W-Well―",
    "svo0404_081": "Cut it out, Death Gun.",
    "svo0404_082": "She hid her true face. Even from you.\r\nShe even erased your memories.",
    "svo0404_083": "Yet you—",
    "svo0404_084": "Enough!",
    "svo0404_085": "You say you understand her? How hilarious.\r\nHeh, heh, heh.",
    "svo0404_086": "...",
    "svo0404_087": "Don't let him get to you, Neige. Everything will be clear once we find Fuuka\r\nand get her side of things.",
    "svo0405_001": "A giant gate, huh? Sure screams \"boss lair.\"",
    "svo0405_002": "Oh, Kirito.",
    "svo0405_003": "Sorry to butt in.\r\nCould I have a minute, Heathcliff?",
    "svo0405_004": "Certainly. A few just left to do recon.\r\nWe won't hash out a plan until they return with intel.",
    "svo0405_005": "Our strategy depends on if we're dealing with a boss or Fuuka behind that door.",
    "svo0405_006": "I admit, I never thought I'd see the day where the Knights of the Blood Oath's\r\ncommander and vice commander strategized together again.",
    "svo0405_007": "Honestly, that's a big help.\r\nI'm not really the leader type.",
    "svo0405_008": "That said, I take it you don't have any hacks up your sleeve this time?",
    "svo0405_009": "Indeed. As I have previously stated, I am just an ordinary character with no\r\nadmin privileges in this world.",
    "svo0405_010": "And yet you're willingly teaming up with us. What do you get out of all this?",
    "svo0405_011": "I'll admit, I cannot deny that this current state of affairs fascinates me.\r\nI would relish the opportunity to speak face-to-face with this Fuuka.",
    "svo0405_012": "Should I take that to mean you don't view Fuuka as an enemy to be defeated?\r\nAt least for now?",
    "svo0405_013": "Quite.",
    "svo0405_014": "I'd like to get an unbiased opinion. What do you think it is she's after?",
    "svo0405_015": "Without any hard evidence, it's easy to pose many theories.\r\nLike Death Gun's about her being a bloodthirsty killer.",
    "svo0405_016": "Is that not a legitimate theory?",
    "svo0405_017": "Well, yeah, but it just doesn't sit right. Fuuka's actions don't add up with her\r\npersonality at all—At least, not the way she came across to me.",
    "svo0405_018": "She may have interrupted the investigation of the Test Room,\r\nbut it's not like you guys didn't get any data at all, right?",
    "svo0405_019": "Which is why I was wondering if any of that could possibly shed some light on\r\nher actions and motives.",
    "svo0405_020": "You're hoping to reach a compromise and win her over, aren't you?",
    "svo0405_021": "Honestly, it's mostly because I'm having a hard time watching Neige.",
    "svo0405_022": "I want her to explain to Neige what's on her mind,\r\neven if I have to drag her back by the scruff of her neck.",
    "svo0405_023": "Though I'm aware you guys might not be supportive of that plan,\r\nseeing as how she attacked you and all.",
    "svo0405_024": "That's not true.\r\nI can't think of anything better than not having to settle this with a fight.",
    "svo0405_025": "That said, I can't say anything for sure since I'm not the one who actually\r\nlooked over the Test Room.",
    "svo0405_026": "Well, we didn't find enough to draw any conclusions,\r\nbut I shall impart to you what we learned from the data logs.",
    "svo0405_027": "Five staff members entered the Test Room one after another from 9 AM.",
    "svo0405_028": "The last one entered at 9:26 AM. The ID verifies her as Fuuka.\r\nFuuka Natsuyagi, that is.",
    "svo0405_029": "The Support AI Neige joined at 9:35 AM and testing on Galaxia began afterwards.\r\nThey were performing tests to study how Fuuka would react to various situations.",
    "svo0405_030": "All staff members' vitals were recorded during this period. Fuuka and the rest\r\ntook a break three hours after the start with no significant change in readings\r\nin the interim.",
    "svo0405_031": "It was right afterward that everyone's vitals began displaying abnormalities,\r\none after another. Specifically, their breathing and heart rates suddenly\r\nskyrocketed, and they started to sweat.",
    "svo0405_032": "Does that mean they were scared of something?",
    "svo0405_033": "Not necessarily. Excitement and joy produce similar reactions.\r\nWhatever the case, it was clearly triggered by some sort of intense emotion.",
    "svo0405_034": "After that, everyone's vitals vanished, aside from Fuuka.\r\nThen the system began displaying abnormalities. The log ended there.",
    "svo0405_035": "So the system abnormalities occurred while Fuuka was in the Test Room.",
    "svo0405_036": "She claimed she was wandering around a field at the time,\r\nbut she must have been lying.",
    "svo0405_037": "After that, Fuuka and Neige disappeared,\r\nleaving the staff's bodies behind, right?",
    "svo0405_038": "Correct. Furthermore, no IDs were recorded entering the Test Room at the time.",
    "svo0405_039": "A locked room murder, huh? Then the only ones who could have attacked the staff\r\nmembers were Fuuka or Neige?",
    "svo0405_040": "The wounds indicated a weapon designed for an adult human was likely used.\r\nI believe it would have been somewhat difficult for Neige to have done this.",
    "svo0405_041": "Um, hey, what happens to people who die in this world?",
    "svo0405_042": "Though I cannot say for certain, I find it hard to believe\r\nthey would immediately die in The Real World.\r\nThe latest hardware has numerous layers of safety, does it not?",
    "svo0405_043": "Still, we can't be too optimistic either.\r\nNot when this is a world under Galaxia's influence.",
    "svo0405_044": "Galaxia delivers supremely accurate recreations of experiences.\r\nIf it recreated an experience where you died, then...",
    "svo0405_045": "You'll suffer a painfully realistic death in your head?",
    "svo0405_046": "Wouldn't that...?",
    "svo0405_047": "Yes. It would be dangerous, of course. It could possibly even gravely damage\r\nyour mind, affecting sanity or perhaps putting you into an inescapable coma.",
    "svo0405_048": "Getting PK'd in this world has serious ramifications, then.",
    "svo0405_049": "We found it, Asuna!",
    "svo0405_050": "Oops, sorry, am I interrupting something?",
    "svo0405_051": "Nah, nothing special.\r\nYou four were scouting the boss's lair, right?",
    "svo0405_052": "Yep, we checked it out good.",
    "svo0405_053": "How did it go? Did you find anything?",
    "svo0405_054": "Damn right we did. There's a big-ass monster right inside that room.\r\nLooked like some kind of dragon.",
    "svo0405_055": "I think you'd recognize it too, Asuna.",
    "svo0405_056": "It's something out of ALO, then?",
    "svo0405_057": "No. It was the one from Ordinal Scale who looked just like Pina.\r\nThe one that grew big and attacked us.",
    "svo0405_058": "Dorz'l the Chaos Drake? That one looked pretty tough.",
    "svo0405_059": "Also, we didn't see Fuuka anywhere. Though we didn't turn over every stone,\r\nso I can't say for sure she's not in there.",
    "svo0405_060": "You all did a fine job.\r\nNow get some rest before we undertake this boss battle.",
    "svo0405_061": "Roger!",
    "svo0405_062": "Ooh, having an elegant old man thank me with his sexy voice just gave me the chills!\r\nIt's like my HP went from one to full in a second!",
    "svo0405_063": "Hmm. I cannot say I've ever received such an evaluation of my personage before.",
    "svo0405_064": "Hey, more! Talk some more! Keep it coming!",
    "svo0405_065": "Very well.\r\nWould you like me to utter anything of note?",
    "svo0405_066": "Hmm... Oh, I know!\r\nIn your best impression of a butler, say—",
    "svo0405_067": "Cut it out, Fuka! Quit being so blegh! Come with me!",
    "svo0405_068": "Eh?!",
    "svo0405_069": "I'm surprised you even humored her.",
    "svo0405_070": "Saying a few words is a small price to pay to raise her morale.\r\nI believe I made a rather logical decision.",
    "svo0405_071": "At any rate, do you have further questions, Kirito?",
    "svo0405_072": "Nah, I'm good for now. Thanks.\r\nYou've given me a lot to consider.",
    "svo0405_073": "I fear the situation's only gotten worse for Neige, though.",
    "svo0405_074": "Even still, we need to get past this thing to catch up with Fuuka.",
    "svo0405_075": "Yeah. Let's just focus on the boss fight for now.",
    "svo0405_076": "We beat it, but I don't see Fuuka anywhere.\r\nFigures.",
    "svo0405_077": "Perhaps she used this dragon to buy some time to flee.\r\nIt would appear she is quite adverse to crossing paths again.",
    "svo0405_078": "Fuuka.",
    "svo0405_079": "Looks like all we can do for now is pursue her,\r\nbut what are we going to do if we manage to catch her?",
    "svo0405_080": "Win her over with words?\r\nOr restrain her by force?",
    "svo0405_081": "Do we even have a way to fight her?\r\nWe're talking about an opponent who can freely control giant monsters like this.",
    "svo0405_082": "It just doesn't make sense! Why would a tester have that much authority?!\r\nNone of it adds up no matter how you spin it!",
    "svo0405_083": "I-I don't know. Fuuka should only have had the same level of privileges as any\r\nother player.",
    "svo0405_084": "How can you not know?!",
    "svo0405_085": "Eep!",
    "svo0405_086": "You're an AI made specifically for the Test Room!\r\nHow could you possibly not know?! You goddamn useless—",
    "svo0405_087": "My goodness, what a noisome exchange. It does not appear any fruitful\r\ndiscussion will be accomplished in this environment.",
    "svo0405_088": "\"Noisome?\" Are you referring to me?",
    "svo0405_089": "Oh, there actually is a working brain cell in that skull.\r\nI am thoroughly shocked.",
    "svo0405_090": "But yes. The drivel of one who does nothing other than frighten small children\r\ndeserves no kinder words. And I have no intent to bestow them.",
    "svo0405_091": "If you wish to be taken seriously,\r\nthen say something actually constructive next time.",
    "svo0405_092": "Why you! Do you have any idea who I am?",
    "svo0405_093": "Cut it out, guys! We need to chill out and think this through!",
    "svo0405_094": "Did you find any data in the Test Room relating to Fuuka's capabilities?",
    "svo0405_095": "Could you check, Yuna?",
    "svo0405_096": "Sure, just give me a sec. Let's see.",
    "svo0405_097": "Avatar Name: Fuuka. Real Name: Fuuka Natsuyagi. Age: 16.",
    "svo0405_098": "Oh, I think I found something.\r\nNote: Suffers from overfitting.",
    "svo0405_099": "What's that?",
    "svo0405_100": "It's a type of FNC—FullDive Non-Conformity. A condition where one overreacts to\r\nsignals sent by VR devices.",
    "svo0405_101": "When most people hear about FNC, they think about people whose vision is\r\nimpaired in VR worlds, making it difficult for them to see.",
    "svo0405_102": "Oh, right, that's what Nezha had.",
    "svo0405_103": "However, overfitting is when you can see things you normally couldn't,\r\neven things you're not meant to see.",
    "svo0405_104": "That said, these are merely the customary classifications,\r\nnot necessarily a strict definition of FNC. Either case is certainly possible.",
    "svo0405_105": "It's just that overfitting is considerably rare and often distinguished.",
    "svo0405_106": "In business, you want as many people as possible to be compatible with your\r\ntechnology. Thus, practically every enterprise in this day and age is studying\r\nways to combat FNC.",
    "svo0405_107": "That's why testers such as her are not all that uncommon.",
    "svo0405_108": "FNC, huh?",
    "svo0405_109": "Eiji?",
    "svo0405_110": "Never mind me, Yuna. It's good they're finding ways to deal with that stuff.",
    "svo0405_111": "Fuuka told us about her condition.\r\nShe said it causes her to see objects such as rocks and trees as digital data.",
    "svo0405_112": "Yeah, her profile says that too.",
    "svo0405_113": "She's so susceptible to visual signals that textures and filter effects don't\r\nmanifest the way they're meant to.",
    "svo0405_114": "Don't see how you could enjoy games like that.",
    "svo0405_115": "It isn't purely a negative.",
    "svo0405_116": "For example, she can notice monster parameter errors during testing,\r\nas well as identify the reason for file corruption and how to fix it.",
    "svo0405_117": "I remember there being cases like that. The staff were impressed too.\r\nThey said her abilities were on par with debugging programs and AI.",
    "svo0405_118": "That would be a deadly combination with admin privileges.\r\nShe would be able to tell at a glance how best to deal with any problems.",
    "svo0405_119": "With that sort of power... Hmm, one could greatly reduce the time required\r\nto put together arts.",
    "svo0405_120": "At least someone seems to be enjoying themselves.",
    "svo0405_121": "Anyway, perhaps summoning monsters and creating boss lairs means she's making\r\nfull use of that power.",
    "svo0405_122": "H-How are we supposed to take on someone like that?!",
    "svo0405_123": "I don't think that makes her omnipotent, though.\r\nThere must be some things she doesn't know or can't do.",
    "svo0405_124": "For example, perhaps she hadn't anticipated us getting into the Test Room.",
    "svo0405_125": "That would be why she panicked and interrupted us after detecting our intrusion.",
    "svo0405_126": "You would be surprised at how difficult it is to be an administrator.",
    "svo0405_127": "We should be able to talk and negotiate with her as long as it's true she can't\r\ncontrol everything the way she wants.",
    "svo0405_128": "You talk a good game.",
    "svo0405_129": "But what if she's killing for laughs?\r\nWon't that just make contacting her even more dangerous?",
    "svo0405_130": "I don't think that's the story.",
    "svo0405_131": "Look, I'm not a pacifist or idealist, but neither am I the type to just make\r\nassumptions about others and not put in the effort to understand them.",
    "svo0405_132": "Umm, then would you let me do the talking with Fuuka?",
    "svo0405_133": "I can't make sense of what she's doing.\r\nAnd I'm sure Fuuka would at least be willing to hear me out.",
    "svo0405_134": "You don't look like you're cut out to be a negotiator.",
    "svo0405_135": "If she really did trust you as a partner, she never would have erased your\r\nmemories in the first place.",
    "svo0405_136": "Well...",
    "svo0405_137": "This Fuuka killed those staff members, right? Seems to me she's using Galaxia\r\nto enjoy all the murder she couldn't get away with in The Real World.",
    "svo0405_138": "She erased this shrimp's memories to hide what she'd done,\r\nand now she's throwing monsters at us like we're a dartboard.",
    "svo0405_139": "We need to take care of her like we would any other serial killer!",
    "svo0405_140": "No, that's wrong.",
    "svo0405_141": "What?",
    "svo0405_142": "I know Death Gun said something to that effect, but I don't think that's right.",
    "svo0405_143": "Because if it were, then why didn't she kill Neige?",
    "svo0405_144": "Your theory is that Fuuka erased Neige's memories to conceal her crimes\r\nand because she didn't trust her, right?",
    "svo0405_145": "But if that's true, it would have been far more efficient and quicker just to\r\nget rid of her altogether.",
    "svo0405_146": "It would have been a cinch with her admin privileges,\r\nand someone who supposedly enjoys killing would never pass on the opportunity.",
    "svo0405_147": "Yeah, good point.\r\nBesides, Fuuka kept working with Neige even after erasing her memories, right?",
    "svo0405_148": "Doesn't that mean it's more likely she was trying to protect Neige in some way?",
    "svo0405_149": "Rgh.",
    "svo0405_150": "Heehee, how amusing.\r\nYou and the boy make a very compelling case.",
    "svo0405_151": "Why did Fuuka resort to such measures?\r\nWhat is she hoping to accomplish in this world?",
    "svo0405_152": "It would make for quite an anticlimax if it turned out she did it all to sate\r\nher own desires.",
    "svo0405_153": "I—",
    "svo0405_154": "I know what she's done, but I still want to see Fuuka again!\r\nAnd when I do, I want to ask her for myself!",
    "svo0405_155": "Yeah, I'm all for that.\r\nWe've got your back.",
    "svo0501_001": "Fortunately, we've got so many members now that we can split into multiple\r\nparties and cover considerably more ground.",
    "svo0501_002": "True, but if Fuuka really does have admin privileges,\r\nshe may not be traveling by conventional means.",
    "svo0501_003": "Let's not worry about that possibility for now.",
    "svo0501_004": "U-Umm, not that I wouldn't be thrilled to have your help looking for Fuuka,\r\nbut are you really sure about this?",
    "svo0501_005": "I promised to escort the both of you to the Test Room.\r\nI haven't fulfilled my end of the bargain yet.",
    "svo0501_006": "We must continue our investigation of this world either way.\r\nI'm certain we will turn up some information on Fuuka as we go.",
    "svo0501_007": "You see, it benefits us as well.",
    "svo0501_008": "Th-Thank you!\r\nI can't begin to apologize for all the trouble I've caused you.",
    "svo0501_009": "With all that said, if I had to wager a guess as to where she's fled,\r\nI would say the world of ALO is a likely candidate.",
    "svo0501_010": "Alice and her group should be out exploring right now.\r\nLet's get everyone together and reorganize once they return.",
    "svo0501_011": "ALO, eh? Normally, we'd know that world like the back of our hands,\r\nbut the maps have changed considerably, haven't they?",
    "svo0501_012": "Yeah, it's best to assume your knowledge of the game won't be much help.",
    "svo0501_013": "What's more, ALO is a really big place. It could take a very long time to\r\nlocate Fuuka if she doesn't want to be found.",
    "svo0501_014": "Fuuka.",
    "svo0501_015": "All that aside, I called you over because I wanted to ask you some questions,\r\nNeige.",
    "svo0501_016": "A-All right.\r\nI'll answer whatever you have to ask as long as it's within my knowledge.",
    "svo0501_017": "Come now, there is no need to be so formal.",
    "svo0501_018": "I just wish to know what sort of person Fuuka is. What is she like?\r\nHow does she think? Those sorts of things.",
    "svo0501_019": "The more we know about her,\r\nthe better chance we have of understanding her motives.",
    "svo0501_020": "Good thinking. We didn't really get to ask her much about her personal life and\r\nall that when we were together.",
    "svo0501_021": "Which is why I'd like you to tell us, Neige.\r\nIt doesn't matter what it is, just anything you can remember will do.",
    "svo0501_022": "Okay, where should I begin then?",
    "svo0501_023": "Hmm, how about with how you met her?",
    "svo0501_024": "Oh, uh, well, I believe I already told Kirito and the others,\r\nbut we met as a tester and a development Support AI.",
    "svo0501_025": "We met on her first day of testing.\r\nI think I introduced myself to her first.",
    "svo0501_026": "You did? Didn't expect that.\r\nI thought Fuuka was the type to speak first in any situation.",
    "svo0501_027": "Yes, she is indeed the sociable kind.\r\nYet I was the one who talked to her first that day. I wonder why?",
    "svo0501_028": "Oh, right, the staff were all absorbed in their own work,\r\nand I thought she looked lonely all by herself.",
    "svo0501_029": "When I saw that, something in me told me I had to say something to her.\r\nUmm, I think I began by asking her name.",
    "svo0501_030": "And then she said,\r\n\"Wow, our names both have to do with snow, huh? What're the odds of that?\"",
    "svo0501_031": "Snow?",
    "svo0501_032": "\"Neige\" is French for snow, while \"Fuuka\" can also be read as \"Kazahana,\"\r\nwhich is another word for snow.",
    "svo0501_033": "Heh, learn something new every day.",
    "svo0501_034": "The two of us hit it off from there.",
    "svo0501_035": "She was the only tester who went to the Test Room.",
    "svo0501_036": "As such, we ended up talking about all sorts of things, such as school,\r\nwhat was happening in her life, her favorite movies, and the like.",
    "svo0501_037": "Hmm, this Fuuka sounds like quite the chatterbox.",
    "svo0501_038": "Indeed. She certainly does love to talk.",
    "svo0501_039": "But I think she loves making others happy even more.",
    "svo0501_040": "She would make the happiest smiles whenever I smiled.\r\nThe kind that made it look like she was having the time of her life.",
    "svo0501_041": "She may act like a free spirit who can't read the room,\r\nbut I believe she's a girl with a sincere heart.",
    "svo0501_042": "I'm sure there must be a good reason for what she's—",
    "svo0501_043": "Hmph, ridiculous.",
    "svo0501_044": "Sugou.",
    "svo0501_045": "How could someone with a sincere heart kill people without batting an eye,\r\nvirtual or otherwise?",
    "svo0501_046": "Oh, like you're one to talk!\r\nHave you forgotten what you did?",
    "svo0501_047": "We are analyzing the enemy, not me. You can dress her up however you like,\r\nbut all I see is a loathsome creature that must be dealt with!",
    "svo0501_048": "Urk.",
    "svo0501_049": "Watch your tongue, Oberon.",
    "svo0501_050": "It is not making assumptions about Fuuka and criticizing her that we should be\r\ndoing, but rather reporting on what we just discovered.",
    "svo0501_051": "Oh yeah, you guys were out scouting, right?\r\nWhat'd you find?",
    "svo0501_052": "I hope it's good news.",
    "svo0501_053": "Loathe as I am to admit it, your hopes are for naught. Not only did we not\r\nfind anything of worth, we also spotted hordes of monsters on the prairies.",
    "svo0501_054": "Great. Just great. I didn't see them when we passed through.\r\nSure picked a hell of a time to respawn.",
    "svo0501_055": "I was the one who spotted them first. Their numbers chilled me to the bone.\r\nWe should avoid searching that region and head elsewhere.",
    "svo0501_056": "There's really that many?",
    "svo0501_057": "You oversell them, Oberon.\r\nClearly, your cowardice has grown.",
    "svo0501_058": "I-I believe the appropriate phrasing would be that I am cautious and prudent!",
    "svo0501_059": "That said, there are indeed a considerable number of them, both flying\r\nand armed. They're likely more ferocious than any beasts we have encountered\r\nthus far in this world.",
    "svo0501_060": "However, I do believe we should be able to handle them.",
    "svo0501_061": "And since they will prove a hurdle to travel and exploration,\r\nperhaps we could benefit other players as well by exterminating them.",
    "svo0501_062": "Hmm, excellent work. Then let's group up.",
    "svo0501_063": "We shall prepare for battle and march on the prairies of ALO!",
    "svo0501_064": "Whew! Think that's most of them?",
    "svo0501_065": "It would appear so.",
    "svo0501_066": "Good work, everyone!",
    "svo0501_067": "But whew, it's not every day you see that many monsters amassing like that.",
    "svo0501_068": "It was almost as if they were trying to fight as an army.\r\nI've never seen anything like that before in this world.",
    "svo0501_069": "It seems to me it was the work of that Fuuka girl.\r\nShe really is our enemy.",
    "svo0501_070": "We don't know that for sure!\r\nThat's why we're going to talk with her!",
    "svo0501_071": "And suppose she attacks us the moment we attempt to open dialogue?\r\nDo you have any guarantee she will not pull a stunt like that?",
    "svo0501_072": "Th-Then I'll just go meet with her alone!\r\nThat way none of you will be in dang—",
    "svo0501_073": "Calm down, Neige. Don't jump the gun. Of course we're coming with you.\r\nYou don't have to bear all the danger and responsibility alone.",
    "svo0501_074": "Besides, there's a number of things that don't make sense if we assume she's our\r\nenemy.",
    "svo0501_075": "Take this incident, for example. If this was her doing, why would she bring that many monsters together?",
    "svo0501_076": "To slow us down so we can't catch her?",
    "svo0501_077": "That's a reasonable answer, I admit.\r\nBut wouldn't it have the opposite effect if she didn't want us chasing her?",
    "svo0501_078": "Leaving a horde of monsters in that spot to slow us down is as good as\r\nannouncing we're hot on her trail.",
    "svo0501_079": "Good point. It would have been more efficient to go into hiding without leaving\r\nany hints if she wanted to shake us.",
    "svo0501_080": "I see. And what do you think, A—\r\nHuh? Alice?",
    "svo0501_081": "...",
    "svo0501_082": "What's the matter, Alice?",
    "svo0501_083": "Oh, well, it's these enemies.\r\nI get the sense something is different compared to when we first found them.",
    "svo0501_084": "As if there were less than there should have been.",
    "svo0501_085": "What? Are you insinuating I miscounted?",
    "svo0501_086": "Not at all. I saw for myself what you had reported.",
    "svo0501_087": "But the more I think back on it, the less it adds up.\r\nThe horde is definitely smaller than when we scouted them.",
    "svo0501_088": "How can that be?\r\nDid something else run into them before us?",
    "svo0501_089": "If that's the case, could there be other potential allies?",
    "svo0501_090": "I sure hope so.",
    "svo0501_091": "Anyway, let's go on ahead.\r\nWe should be coming up on the World Tree.",
    "svo0501_092": "I wonder if Fuuka's there.",
    "svo0502_001": "Wow, you're a diva, Yuna? Awesome!",
    "svo0502_002": "I'd share one of my songs with you if we weren't in this predicament.\r\nDungeons have a really nice echo to them.",
    "svo0502_003": "When sound bounces around a room and creates an echo, that's called reverb,\r\nisn't it?",
    "svo0502_004": "Right, that thing where you can hear your voice clearly when you sing in the\r\nshower.",
    "svo0502_005": "Songs and music make people happy.\r\nThey can bring smiles to everyone.",
    "svo0502_006": "That's true.\r\nMost people seem to enjoy playing instruments or listening to music.",
    "svo0502_007": "But those two haven't smiled even once.",
    "svo0502_008": "...",
    "svo0502_009": "...",
    "svo0502_010": "Want me to sing?",
    "svo0502_011": "You don't have to.\r\nWe're the vanguard, so let's take care of our own work first.",
    "svo0502_012": "Oh, okay.\r\nUmm, Kirito asked us to scout this dungeon we found near the World Tree, right?",
    "svo0502_013": "There are no monsters in the vicinity at the moment.",
    "svo0502_014": "But there ARE traces of fighting here and there.\r\nWas this Fuuka's doing?",
    "svo0502_015": "Or maybe there really is someone ahead of us pursuing her, just like Kirito\r\nsuggested. What do you guys think?",
    "svo0502_016": "...",
    "svo0502_017": "...",
    "svo0502_018": "Not much for chitchat, are you boys?",
    "svo0502_019": "You wouldn't happen to have a bone to pick with each other, would you?",
    "svo0502_020": "Not personally. However, I do know him—no, THEM—quite well.",
    "svo0502_021": "They were members of Laughing Coffin in SAO—A murder guild who were out of\r\nharmony with the regular players.",
    "svo0502_022": "Though he appears to be using his GGO avatar at present.",
    "svo0502_023": "Heh heh. You Knights of the Blood Oath.\r\nYou were equally disharmonic.",
    "svo0502_024": "You were nothing but prey.\r\nSomething to be hunted.",
    "svo0502_025": "Think you can kill me?",
    "svo0502_026": "Shall we find out? Heh, heh, heh.",
    "svo0502_027": "You guys are too edgy! You're total drags!\r\nAnd no one likes a drag!",
    "svo0502_028": "She's right. The situation is already tense as it is.\r\nLet's all work together.",
    "svo0502_029": "Work together you say?",
    "svo0502_030": "...",
    "svo0502_031": "Heard of bullet lines?",
    "svo0502_032": "In GGO, you see where your bullet hits even before you fire.\r\nThough, at this range, you'd be dead by the time you saw it.",
    "svo0502_033": "Want a demonstration?",
    "svo0502_034": "Huh?",
    "svo0502_035": "I have no qualms with us using each other, but I don't play nice.\r\nDon't be a fool and assume I'll always be an ally.",
    "svo0502_036": "I could kill you with a pull of the trigger.\r\nDeath is always closer than you think.",
    "svo0502_037": "Heh, heh. Watch closely―",
    "svo0502_038": "Eep!",
    "svo0502_039": "...!",
    "svo0502_040": "Death is close, huh?",
    "svo0502_041": "Then shouldn't you be finding a happier way of spending your time than ranting\r\nabout killing or being killed?",
    "svo0502_042": "That's why we all sing and smile together.\r\nYou can only do those when you're alive. Anything else is a waste.",
    "svo0502_043": "Interesting words, when your sword is at my throat.",
    "svo0502_044": "Well, there are some things you can't get into others' heads without a little\r\nextra hint. Such as how serious I am.",
    "svo0502_045": "A hint? Heh, heh.\r\nYou think you can stop me?",
    "svo0502_046": "My hands are fast as lightning.\r\nMy gun does not miss.",
    "svo0502_047": "I'm sure that's true.",
    "svo0502_048": "But I know I'm faster.\r\nWanna test me?",
    "svo0502_049": "...",
    "svo0502_050": "Whaddya say you take that hand off the gun, then?\r\nYou're scaring Yui.",
    "svo0502_051": "And if you don't comply...",
    "svo0502_052": "...I'll cut you to ribbons.",
    "svo0502_053": "Meh.",
    "svo0502_054": "Thank you so much, Yuuki.",
    "svo0502_055": "You're welcome.",
    "svo0502_056": "You've got some serious guts, huh?",
    "svo0502_057": "No, not at all.",
    "svo0502_058": "I just think it's best to be upfront and honest about how you feel.\r\nFewer regrets that way.",
    "svo0502_059": "Be honest about how you feel?\r\nI think that puts it quite nicely.",
    "svo0502_060": "Huh?",
    "svo0502_061": "You guys hear that?",
    "svo0502_062": "Are those monsters?\r\nWhat should we do?",
    "svo0502_063": "We're on scout duty, so let's just take a look.\r\nWe'll retreat after we see what we're dealing with and go tell the others.",
    "svo0502_064": "You on the same page, Death Gun?\r\nThen let's hit the road!",
    "svo0502_065": "Hmph.",
    "svo0502_066": "I just got a report from Yuuki.\r\nThey've encountered monsters and signs of battle.",
    "svo0502_067": "Roger.",
    "svo0502_068": "What's our move?",
    "svo0502_069": "Well, waiting won't solve anything. We need to keep moving.\r\nJust be prepared to fight.",
    "svo0502_070": "Wait, why the heck do I have to issue orders?\r\nYou're the commander here! Do your job.",
    "svo0502_071": "I am not fit for the role of leader or leading man as it stands.\r\nYou are best suited for that role, Kirito.",
    "svo0502_072": "That is not to say I intend to put in any less effort.",
    "svo0502_073": "Lady Cardinal also said to entrust on-the-fly decisions to you.",
    "svo0502_074": "Mmm, that's gonna be pretty hard with such a big group.",
    "svo0502_075": "I'm sorry.",
    "svo0502_076": "Don't worry about it. I'm the one who decided to go after Fuuka anyway.",
    "svo0502_077": "Still, the signs of battle trouble me.",
    "svo0502_078": "If this Fuuka has the level of access to control the monsters,\r\nshe wouldn't need to fight them.",
    "svo0502_079": "Meaning that someone other than us is following her.",
    "svo0502_080": "And if the signs of this fight are any indication,\r\nthey're one step ahead of us.",
    "svo0502_081": "That does seem the logical conclusion.",
    "svo0502_082": "Whether or not Fuuka is actually responsible, it makes sense someone would be\r\npursuing over the PKs.",
    "svo0502_083": "If Heathcliff is right, they would have to not only be one step ahead of us,\r\nbut also be one tough cookie.",
    "svo0502_084": "They're knocking down hordes like bowling pins.",
    "svo0502_085": "So Fuuka's being targeted by someone who can really fight.",
    "svo0502_086": "We don't know what their goal is, but it's clear they're going straight for her.\r\nWe don't have any time to waste.",
    "svo0502_087": "You're right. We should get ready and go.",
    "svo0502_088": "Hm. It seems the monsters have been taken care of.",
    "svo0502_089": "How boring. These monsters lack any character. There's just a lot of them.",
    "svo0502_090": "I will say, that was a nice show of your skill in battle, Lady Pontifex.\r\nAssuming you're an ally, I feel very reassured.",
    "svo0502_091": "Hehe! Assuming I am, indeed.",
    "svo0502_092": "The subtext in that statement is palpable.\r\nMight you have something you'd like to share with us, little Alice?",
    "svo0502_093": "I'd prefer to save it for another time and venue.",
    "svo0502_094": "No need to wait. It would be a shame to let this reunion of ours go to waste.\r\nWhy don't we have a nice, long conver—",
    "svo0502_095": "You really blew the roof off, Quinella!\r\nYou're always a fine sight to see.",
    "svo0502_096": "Oh. Am I interrupting something, Alice?",
    "svo0502_097": "Nothing important. I'll be departing now.",
    "svo0502_098": "You never change. Still as humorless as ever.",
    "svo0502_099": "Quinella, I didn't know you and Alice knew each other.",
    "svo0502_100": "That is unimportant.\r\nI wonder, have your talents for flattery improved?",
    "svo0502_101": "Wh-What? Uhh, let's see. Y-Your grace is like the rays of the sun,\r\ngently blessing the earth beneath our—",
    "svo0502_102": "Dear lord, here he goes.",
    "svo0502_103": "Some guys never learn. You think he actually has a shot?",
    "svo0502_104": "You wanna wager on it?",
    "svo0502_105": "Not really. I have a feeling we'd bet the same way.",
    "svo0502_106": "I think he'd do a lot better if he relaxed a bit.\r\nHe's just spinnin' his wheels.",
    "svo0502_107": "Well, this lady he seems so taken with—Quinella, right?\r\nShe seems like she's used ta being admired.",
    "svo0502_108": "Anyway, Kii-boy 'n Allie seem to know her. Wonder what that's about.",
    "svo0502_109": "You don't know? Figured you'd have the inside scoop.",
    "svo0502_110": "What can ya do? Sure, I hear plenty about high-level players,\r\nbut I can't know everything.",
    "svo0502_111": "Maybe I need ta do some pokin' around.",
    "svo0502_112": "...",
    "svo0502_113": "Whoops. Think she heard?",
    "svo0502_114": "Nah.",
    "svo0502_115": "Hey, Argo. You notice anythin' weird?",
    "svo0502_116": "The hairs on my neck are startin' to stand.\r\nMight be somethin' dangerous nearby—",
    "svo0502_117": "In the room at the back! There's something huge!",
    "svo0502_118": "That's—",
    "svo0502_119": "Fuuka!",
    "svo0502_120": "Neige! Don't move!",
    "svo0502_121": "B-But Fuuka's right there!",
    "svo0502_122": "...",
    "svo0502_123": "No, he can't be here.",
    "svo0502_124": "No doubt about it. I know this aura.",
    "svo0502_125": "Emperor Vecta! What is he doing here?!",
    "svo0503_001": "Kirito! That sound must've been—",
    "svo0503_002": "Whoa! Is that the boss monster?\r\nSomeone's fighting it already.",
    "svo0503_003": "Hold the phone. Is it just me or is that guy crazy strong?\r\nHe's demolishing that boss by himself!",
    "svo0503_004": "You three got here at the perfect time!\r\nCan you give us some support fire while we get in close?",
    "svo0503_005": "Sure thing!",
    "svo0503_006": "With a target that big it'll be hard to miss!",
    "svo0503_007": "No, not the monster!",
    "svo0503_008": "Huh?",
    "svo0503_009": "We're gonna take down the guy!",
    "svo0503_010": "Are you serious?",
    "svo0503_011": "You mean the guy fighting the monster? Isn't it bad to die in this world?",
    "svo0503_012": "I'll explain later! For now, just—",
    "svo0503_013": "We'll back you up! Go!",
    "svo0503_014": "Thanks, Sinon! Anyone with legs that work, follow us!",
    "svo0503_015": "LLENN! Fuka! Rain fire! Shoot to kill!\r\nYou can't let up on this guy!",
    "svo0503_016": "Wh-Whuhhh?!",
    "svo0503_017": "Whatever! Just don't blame me if this goes south!",
    "svo0503_018": "No way! How does someone dodge like that?!",
    "svo0503_019": "What the heck? Cheater! He's gotta be cheating!",
    "svo0503_020": "Keep shooting! It keeps him busy even if you miss!",
    "svo0503_021": "Fuuka! Get away from him! Over here!",
    "svo0503_022": "Fuuka!",
    "svo0503_023": "Stay back!",
    "svo0503_024": "What?",
    "svo0503_025": "Wh-Why would she—?",
    "svo0503_026": "There's no time to think about it!\r\nPush in!",
    "svo0503_027": "Ngaaahhh!",
    "svo0503_028": "...",
    "svo0503_029": "Fuuka, run!",
    "svo0503_030": "Grrrk...",
    "svo0503_030_2": "Agh...",
    "svo0503_031": "What?",
    "svo0503_032": "Hm. How glorious.",
    "svo0503_033": "Fuuka... Fuuka!",
    "svo0503_034": "Well, then.",
    "svo0503_035": "It feels like we just saw each other yesterday,\r\nbut I also get the feeling it has been quite some time. How strange.",
    "svo0503_036": "I'm incredibly happy for this reunion, Black Swordsman.\r\nA.L.I.C.E... My Alicia.",
    "svo0503_037": "How? How are you here? What is the meaning of this?!",
    "svo0503_038": "No way!",
    "svo0503_039": "Going straight for the head.\r\nYou've been practicing, haven't you, Sinon?",
    "svo0503_040": "Gabriel Miller.",
    "svo0503_041": "Or should I call you Emperor Vecta? Subtilizer, maybe?\r\nWhat identity do you prefer today?",
    "svo0503_042": "Whichever you like. Names are simple signifiers.\r\nThey change nothing about one's nature.",
    "svo0503_043": "It can't be. Fuuka?",
    "svo0503_044": "Her wounds won't close!",
    "svo0503_045": "Stay with us Fuuka! Don't give up! You have to stay awake!",
    "svo0503_046": "What are you doing here? Were you following her all this time?",
    "svo0503_047": "Precisely.",
    "svo0503_048": "Her soul was as exquisite as I expected.\r\nFar more palatable than the other riffraff.",
    "svo0503_049": "Riffraff? Were you responsible for the other player killings?",
    "svo0503_050": "(What's this pressure I'm feeling?\r\nIf I'm not careful, this might go worse than our last fight.)",
    "svo0503_051": "(I can barely move! Damn!)",
    "svo0503_052": "I see you've brought me several souls I'd love to sample.\r\nQuite the feast.",
    "svo0503_053": "Allow me to thank you, Kirito.\r\nIt seems I have several more courses now.",
    "svo0503_054": "Kirito, something is wrong. We can't fight him here!",
    "svo0503_055": "(I know. She's right. Even all of us together can't defeat him.)",
    "svo0503_056": "(But how do we escape?)",
    "svo0503_057": "Oh, but what a waste it would be to devour you all at once.\r\nI'd much rather savor you one by one.",
    "svo0503_058": "Ngaaahhh!",
    "svo0503_059": "Ngh!",
    "svo0503_060": "(It didn't hurt him at all!)",
    "svo0503_061": "Will you be the appetizer then?\r\nI've no complaints with that.",
    "svo0503_062": "Kirito!",
    "svo0503_063": "Get out of here, all of you! I'll slow him down!",
    "svo0503_064": "Hm. Always the stubborn one. How long will you cling to your feeble life?",
    "svo0503_065": "(Oh no. I can't hold out long!)",
    "svo0503_066": "System Command: Teleport!",
    "svo0503_067": "Mm?",
    "svo0503_068": "Ah, so you had some life left in you?\r\nI regret that I wasn't able to enjoy the experience down to the final moment.",
    "svo0503_069": "No matter. It seems you will live to fight another day, Black Swordsman.",
    "svo0503_070": "...\r\nA-Am I saved?",
    "svo0503_071": "Fuuka! Fuuka!",
    "svo0503_072": "Ow, ow, ow!",
    "svo0503_073": "I messed up. That was supposed to go better.",
    "svo0503_074": "Don't talk. Just wait. I'll figure something out.",
    "svo0503_075": "Daddy, I think she's—",
    "svo0503_076": "She's right. I waited too long. I can't recover from this.",
    "svo0503_077": "No! Don't give up!",
    "svo0503_078": "I'm out of time. Listen.",
    "svo0503_079": "Gabriel is still alive. I only sent him far away.",
    "svo0503_080": "You saved us.",
    "svo0503_081": "Ahaha. It's not like you owe me, though.",
    "svo0503_082": "He's terrifyingly strong.",
    "svo0503_083": "Don't engage him until you find a way to overtake him.",
    "svo0503_084": "In this world, Gabriel kills. So... he can kill.",
    "svo0503_085": "...\r\nNeige.",
    "svo0503_086": "Wh-What?\r\nWhat is it, Fuuka?",
    "svo0503_087": "You're a real scaredy-cat, you know?\r\nBut you can change if you really try to. Remember that.",
    "svo0503_088": "I cast a little spell. Find the four guardians and the four clues.",
    "svo0503_089": "Sp-Spell? Guardians?",
    "svo0503_090": "\"Clues?\" Are they some kind of item?",
    "svo0503_091": "Please, watch over Neige.",
    "svo0503_092": "Ah!",
    "svo0503_093": "No! Fuuka, no!\r\nFuuka!",
    "svo0503_094": "She's gone.",
    "svo0504_001": "Where's Neige? Is she all right?",
    "svo0504_002": "It hit her hard. Asuna and the others are looking after her.",
    "svo0504_003": "Who was that man? I felt a horrifying emptiness from him.",
    "svo0504_004": "Maybe it's just me, but didn't he act a lot like a GGO player?",
    "svo0504_005": "He was faster and his skills more polished than anyone I know, though.",
    "svo0504_006": "No joke. He was, like, dodging our bullets!",
    "svo0504_007": "That's because he's won Bullet of Bullets. Twice.\r\nNobody stood a chance against him.",
    "svo0504_008": "F-For real?",
    "svo0504_009": "Hmph. I've heard the rumors.\r\nSo that's him.",
    "svo0504_010": "In GGO, he went by \"Subtilizer.\"\r\nAnd in Underworld, he was known as Emperor Vecta.",
    "svo0504_011": "Wait, Vecta?!",
    "svo0504_012": "You mean Vecta the God of Darkness? So he's the emperor of the Dark Territory?\r\nWhat in the world is going on?",
    "svo0504_013": "He's a human who entered Underworld, just like me.",
    "svo0504_014": "His real name is Gabriel Miller. He owns a private military company.\r\nBasically, he's a mercenary.",
    "svo0504_015": "He led the team that broke into the Ocean Turtle to capture Alice.",
    "svo0504_016": "Capture Alice?",
    "svo0504_017": "He's the one you beat in there, right?",
    "svo0504_018": "Yeah. I heard he died after that, but—",
    "svo0504_019": "Somehow he's back.",
    "svo0504_020": "And stronger than before.",
    "svo0504_021": "Fuuka was right. He's too strong for us to face.\r\nHe's a born killer who enjoys nothing more than ending lives.",
    "svo0504_022": "Wh-What do you suggest we do, then? You must have a plan!",
    "svo0504_023": "Fuuka said we shouldn't fight him until we find the way to defeat him.",
    "svo0504_024": "And after our scuffle just now, I understand why. We don't stand a chance\r\nagainst him as we are. He's too strong.",
    "svo0504_025": "If we come across him, we run. That's all we can do for now.",
    "svo0504_026": "Why did you have to incur the wrath of one so ghastly? He surely took us to be\r\nyour allies! I didn't ask for this!",
    "svo0504_027": "Hmm.",
    "svo0504_028": "Do you have something to say, Kayaba?",
    "svo0504_029": "In a sense, the fate of those two is part of your legacy.\r\nYou are not entirely uninvolved.",
    "svo0504_030": "What are you talking about?",
    "svo0504_031": "Then again, I suppose that information isn't particularly relevant to the current situation.",
    "svo0504_032": "I will do some thinking about Gabriel.",
    "svo0504_033": "The state of this world encourages him—and those like him—to exist.\r\nI find it somewhat interesting.",
    "svo0504_034": "However, now that we have lost Fuuka, we have one major problem.",
    "svo0504_035": "And what is that?",
    "svo0504_036": "As you all know, the Galaxia system is currently under lockdown.",
    "svo0504_037": "And the keys required to unlock it are Fuuka Natsuyagi's\r\nvoice print and brainwave patterns.",
    "svo0504_038": "Meaning with her dead, we have no way to unlock and restore the system?",
    "svo0504_039": "I'm hesitant to say it's impossible. But it is clear that, as of now,\r\nwe have lost our means of accessing and normalizing the system.",
    "svo0504_040": "We will have to find another way.",
    "svo0504_041": "That reminds me, Fuuka mentioned something about four guardians and four clues.",
    "svo0504_042": "Sounds to me like she wanted us to beat four monsters and get whatever they're\r\nguarding. That seems the obvious meaning.",
    "svo0504_043": "But what could the clues be?",
    "svo0504_044": "Maybe to help us fight Gabriel?",
    "svo0504_045": "I dunno if anything will help us against someone that powerful.",
    "svo0504_046": "Bet it'd feel really great to beat the crap of him though!",
    "svo0504_047": "Nothing is truly immortal. There must be a way.",
    "svo0504_048": "We can't be sure they'll help us beat Gabriel...",
    "svo0504_049": "...but finding the clues Fuuka left for us might help us learn what her\r\nmotives were.",
    "svo0504_050": "So for now let's look for any monsters that could be the guardians\r\nshe mentioned.",
    "svo0504_051": "It seems like it would be a good idea to continue the search in parties.",
    "svo0504_052": "I'm fine with that. But what about Neige?",
    "svo0504_053": "Oh, yeah, maybe we should have a group stay here to look after—",
    "svo0504_054": "I'm fine. Let me help.",
    "svo0504_055": "N-Neige?",
    "svo0504_056": "Will that really be all right?",
    "svo0504_057": "I tried to tell her that humans and AI both need rest to recover when they\r\naren't doing well. But...",
    "svo0504_058": "She's sure she wants to come with us.",
    "svo0504_059": "I didn't get to speak to her much, but I know Fuuka didn't betray or use me.",
    "svo0504_060": "Of that I'm sure.",
    "svo0504_061": "I have to know what she was trying to do.",
    "svo0504_062": "Besides, Fuuka has only left this world as it is now.\r\nIf we can return it to normal, then maybe I'll see her again.",
    "svo0504_063": "I have to do whatever I can to try and make that happen.",
    "svo0504_064": "I see you've made up your mind.\r\nOkay. We'll take you with us.",
    "svo0504_065": "Thank you!",
    "svo0504_066": "Now that that's settled, let's get moving!",
    "svo0504_067": "We'll find those guardians in no time! I know it!",
    "svo0504_068": "So anyway, we came here because we found a door to a new area.",
    "svo0504_069": "The scenery is pretty fantastic. It's like we're underwater.\r\nIs this ALO too?",
    "svo0504_070": "I think so. Probably.",
    "svo0504_071": "Actually, I remember this place clearly.",
    "svo0504_072": "The Undersea Temple, right? We came here together.",
    "svo0504_073": "The event with the whale! That was so fun!\r\nOh, but then—",
    "svo0504_074": "Things didn't go so well when we met the boss monster.",
    "svo0504_075": "What kind of boss was it?",
    "svo0504_076": "A g-giant octopus?!",
    "svo0504_077": "Yup. Really huge. Kind of like—",
    "svo0504_078": "THAT!",
    "svo0504_079": "Everyone watch out! It's Kraken the Abyss Lord!",
    "svo0504_080": "It dropped something when we beat it.\r\nDoes that mean it was one of the guardians?",
    "svo0504_081": "A book? Is this one of Fuuka's clues?",
    "svo0504_082": "Is it locked or something? It won't open.",
    "svo0504_083": "Do you know anything about this, Neige?",
    "svo0504_084": "Can I see it?",
    "svo0504_085": "If this pass can open it, it must be a recording from Fuuka.",
    "svo0504_086": "Is it okay for us to look at it?",
    "svo0504_087": "It may be her private data, but I'm sure Fuuka left it like this because\r\nshe decided it needed to be seen.",
    "svo0504_088": "Let's bring it back and have Cardinal analyze it.",
    "svo0505_001": "FNC—FullDive Non-Conformity.",
    "svo0505_002": "A condition which causes a disruption in the signal between a VR device\r\nand brain, limiting the user's activity in the VR space.",
    "svo0505_003": "I am one of the users who suffers from this condition.",
    "svo0505_004": "While my case isn't severe enough to prevent me from FullDiving entirely,\r\nI am unable to experience VR worlds as intended.",
    "svo0505_005": "My symptoms manifest visually.",
    "svo0505_006": "I was so excited to jump into the world of ALO for the first time.\r\nWhat I was met with was a pristine blue sky and the outline of a beautiful town.",
    "svo0505_007": "But layered on top of that were clusters of numbers and letters.",
    "svo0505_008": "Thinking my AmuSphere was defective, I called the manufacturer's support center\r\nand had it exchanged for a new one. But the problem persisted.",
    "svo0505_009": "After that, I had a number of tests done at the company's recommendation.\r\nIt was then I learned my symptoms were caused by FNC.",
    "svo0505_010": "Since I liked games and was excited to experience FullDive,\r\nI was honestly pretty depressed about it.",
    "svo0505_011": "Then one day, I was contacted by the engineer in charge of running my tests.",
    "svo0505_012": "They were developing a new feature called \"Galaxia\" and wanted my help.",
    "svo0505_013": "They said this type of FNC is a rare condition, and they would pay me to be a tester for them.",
    "svo0505_014": "Is this the clue Kii-boy brought back?",
    "svo0505_015": "Indeed. It's a book-type item, though the contents are no more than a typical\r\ndocument file.",
    "svo0505_016": "I also linked her pass with the Test Room to enable some of its functionality.",
    "svo0505_017": "Galaxia's core systems are inaccessible as they are locked down,\r\nbut simple analysis can be performed here.",
    "svo0505_018": "That's real cool and all, but wouldn't it be easier just to read it with your\r\nown eyes first?",
    "svo0505_019": "That it does.",
    "svo0505_020": "Could it be her diary? That's what it reads like.",
    "svo0505_021": "One of Fuuka's responsibilities as a member of the Galaxia project was writing\r\nreports.",
    "svo0505_022": "She recorded numerical data, of course, but subjective feelings and changes in\r\nmental state were also valuable data points for her research.",
    "svo0505_023": "She recorded what she felt during testing daily.\r\nIn a sense, Asuna would be correct to call it a diary.",
    "svo0505_024": "It doesn't feel right to be reading a girl's diary.",
    "svo0505_025": "But she herself made mention of these clues, did she not?\r\nThe information within may be of use to us.",
    "svo0505_026": "Yes. That is why I would like you all to inspect the contents.",
    "svo0505_027": "Shall I display the rest?",
    "svo0505_028": "I thought about it and decided to accept the offer.",
    "svo0505_029": "VR technology is sure to become more and more essential in the future.\r\nNot only for gaming, but in a number of fields.",
    "svo0505_030": "By cooperating, I could help advance treatment for my condition. It was my\r\nchance to contribute to society even though I didn't have much going for me.",
    "svo0505_031": "That was my reasoning for taking the job.",
    "svo0505_032": "My job here is to test the expanded functions of Galaxia.",
    "svo0505_033": "The system can apparently digitize any sensation or emotion and reconstruct\r\npast experiences with amazing accuracy.",
    "svo0505_034": "It's a huge leap forward, far beyond state-of-the-art.\r\nThe tech of the future, they say.",
    "svo0505_035": "The firm in charge of development is a start-up, but the core system itself was\r\nprovided by another company.",
    "svo0505_036": "And what's more, they gave it away for free! There are definitely some\r\nengineers out there with very specific interests.",
    "svo0505_037": "But I'm getting off topic. Back to myself.",
    "svo0505_038": "I work in a Test Room constructed within ALO.\r\nIt's a space designed for deploying Galaxia's systems for testing.",
    "svo0505_039": "I—Fuuka Natsuyagi—enter the Test Room in my avatar, Fuuka,\r\nand test the system to reduce the visual symptoms of FullDive Non-Conformity.",
    "svo0505_040": "I think my first goal is to make the game playable without discomfort.",
    "svo0505_041": "The dev staff are all passionate about VR and excited to be working on\r\ncutting-edge tech. Everyone seems to love their job.",
    "svo0505_042": "Oh, and an AI from the Test Room called Neige started working with me.",
    "svo0505_043": "Her personality is the complete opposite of mine.\r\nI hope we get along.",
    "svo0505_044": "Looks like that's it for this file.",
    "svo0505_045": "I also analyzed the file data just in case, but it seems that the only\r\ninformation of any use was found within the document itself.",
    "svo0505_046": "I found no hidden data or messages.",
    "svo0505_047": "In other words, you still haven't learned a thing.",
    "svo0505_048": "Remember, there are four clues. We can't be sure until we have them all.",
    "svo0505_049": "Something tells me I should refrain from getting my hopes up.\r\nOur efforts may earn us no more than worthless trinkets.",
    "svo0505_050": "On that point I must disagree, Sugou.\r\nYou may end up thinking this is a waste of time.",
    "svo0505_051": "However, I see an interesting and significant opportunity.",
    "svo0505_052": "...",
    "svo0505_053": "In any case, there are three more clues you must find.\r\nYou have your work cut out for you.",
    "svo0505_054": "So we keep exploring the world, find monsters that could be the guardians,\r\nand collect the last three document files.",
    "svo0505_055": "Hmm. But this diary...",
    "svo0505_056": "What about it?",
    "svo0505_057": "No, it's nothing. I'm probably overthinking it.",
    "svo0505_058": "Our biggest problem right now is Gabriel.\r\nFuuka teleported him away, but he won't give up on finding us.",
    "svo0505_059": "We have to track down the rest of the clues and figure out a way to deal\r\nwith him before he captures us again. That's how we win.",
    "svo0505_060": "Then you haven't much time. I will let you get back to your search.",
    "svo0505_061": "You will split into parties for the search, report to me when you find an enemy,\r\nand reassemble in order to combat it. Is that acceptable?",
    "svo0505_062": "That takes care of all the monsters! Good work, everyone!",
    "svo0505_063": "They didn't put up much of a fight.",
    "svo0505_064": "Kirito instructed us to locate monsters strong enough to be the guardians,\r\nbut there don't seem to be any in this area.",
    "svo0505_065": "There's no time to dilly-dally. Let's go to the next area.",
    "svo0505_066": "Eiji, right? Let me ask you something.",
    "svo0505_067": "Sure. What is it?",
    "svo0505_068": "Do you use Aincrad Style too?",
    "svo0505_069": "...Aincrad Style?",
    "svo0505_070": "I've never heard it called that, but I did learn it in Aincrad.",
    "svo0505_071": "I see. So you and Kirito are sort of like schoolmates.\r\nI thought your sword technique resembled his.",
    "svo0505_072": "He taught me how to use a sword.",
    "svo0505_073": "I'd rather not be compared to him. If nothing else,\r\nI'm just a fool who couldn't be a hero. I haven't accomplished a thing.",
    "svo0505_074": "O-Oh? You seem very skilled with a sword.",
    "svo0505_075": "But I suppose it's not my place to say.\r\nI don't know you that well yet.",
    "svo0505_076": "Perhaps I've presumed too much.\r\nI'd appreciate it if you could forget I said anything.",
    "svo0505_077": "...",
    "svo0505_078": "No, it's all right. I'm the one who overreacted.",
    "svo0505_079": "I find it hard not to be self-deprecating.\r\nAlthough I do realize it's not good for me.",
    "svo0505_080": "You've got that right!",
    "svo0505_081": "What do you mean, you haven't accomplished a thing?",
    "svo0505_082": "You came all the way to Aincrad to save me after the Ordinal Scale Project!",
    "svo0505_083": "You're right.",
    "svo0505_084": "That's enough self-defeating crap! You're strong, too!\r\nHave some confidence in yourself!",
    "svo0505_085": "May I interject?\r\nI'd like to hear this warrior's opinion, if you don't mind.",
    "svo0505_086": "Yes?",
    "svo0505_087": "In your eyes, how did Vecta's—or rather, Gabriel's—power appear?",
    "svo0505_088": "Abnormal. To sum it up in a word.",
    "svo0505_089": "While we may not understand the rules that govern this world...",
    "svo0505_090": "...we at least know that the combat abilities of us and the others are limited\r\nto what we can comprehend.",
    "svo0505_091": "But that doesn't apply to him.",
    "svo0505_092": "He's either in a different class of avatar, or acting via an entirely separate\r\nsystem. Those are the only explanations.",
    "svo0505_093": "I see. So you believe he is operating within a different set of principles.",
    "svo0505_094": "He certainly does boast extraordinary power and a vast store of Life.\r\nThere may be several mechanisms behind it.",
    "svo0505_095": "Perhaps we could strip him of them somehow.\r\nRunning and hiding isn't exactly my style.",
    "svo0505_096": "You intend to fight him?!",
    "svo0505_097": "Kirito and Cardinal ordered us not to engage him under any circumstances.",
    "svo0505_098": "Tell me, Alice...",
    "svo0505_099": "What would you do if we were to run into him this very moment,\r\nin a situation where escape is impossible?",
    "svo0505_100": "I—",
    "svo0505_101": "Avoiding a foe who can actually be avoided is one thing. There would be no reason\r\nto fear him in that case. But we have no guarantee that will be possible.",
    "svo0505_102": "Although I hate to admit it, there are foes more powerful than I.\r\nAs well as situations where escape is not an option.",
    "svo0505_103": "I have spent my life pondering how to face these threats.\r\nAt times even coming up against the very principles that govern the world.",
    "svo0505_104": "And so this sort of reflection is in my nature.\r\nThough I am not saying you must follow my example.",
    "svo0505_105": "So, basically, we won't lose until we've already given up?",
    "svo0505_106": "It can't possibly be that simple.",
    "svo0505_107": "There is a bit more to it than that but, essentially, yes.\r\nThe impossible can become possible if you will it.",
    "svo0505_108": "Gabriel may be one such being.",
    "svo0505_109": "So that empty will I felt must have been his Incarnation.",
    "svo0505_110": "Incarnation supported by his dreadful delusions, I have no doubt.\r\nHowever, I find it hard to believe that alone is the source of his power.",
    "svo0505_111": "Unfortunately, a concrete means of dealing with him yet evades me.\r\nOur survival rides on the clues Fuuka left for us.",
    "svo0505_112": "And speaking of clues, I see a suspicious-looking door ahead.",
    "svo0505_113": "I have a bad feeling about this.\r\nIt may lead to the guardian's lair.",
    "svo0505_114": "We should get everyone together before we investigate it.\r\nLet's report back to Kirito.",
    "svo0506_001": "This is just my intuition speaking, but I think you're on the right track with\r\nthis door. It makes my skin crawl.",
    "svo0506_002": "That's good. That's good, right?",
    "svo0506_003": "That's the way forward, even if there's a battle with the guardian in store.",
    "svo0506_004": "Anyway, we're here to do recon, so I want to get a look at the target.",
    "svo0506_005": "There are monsters in this area too.",
    "svo0506_006": "For now, let's go as far as we can.",
    "svo0506_007": "Well, ain't this a familiar sight.",
    "svo0506_008": "Is this GGO?",
    "svo0506_009": "I think so. But it doesn't look like an actual map.\r\nIt's like a bunch of different places all patched together.",
    "svo0506_010": "This world you call GGO is... How do I put this?\r\nDifferent.",
    "svo0506_011": "I've seen several different worlds since coming here,\r\nbut the landscapes in this one are totally unlike the natural world I know.",
    "svo0506_012": "It's so hollow and lonely.\r\nI don't think this place is for me.",
    "svo0506_013": "GGO is supposed to be set in a post-apocalyptic future after the collapse\r\nof civilization. It takes its cues from the sci-fi classics. I'm a fan.",
    "svo0506_014": "Why don't you give it a try?\r\nI'll carry you.",
    "svo0506_015": "You make a tempting offer.",
    "svo0506_016": "I'll think about it if this next battle doesn't traumatize me.",
    "svo0506_017": "The boss monster!",
    "svo0506_018": "L-Let's go get the others!",
    "svo0506_019": "Another document file.\r\nShall I play it?",
    "svo0506_020": "Please do.",
    "svo0506_021": "Apparently my FullDive Non-Conformity is a type called \"overfitting.\"",
    "svo0506_022": "Instead of the signals between the VR device and the brain being blocked,\r\nthey pass too freely.",
    "svo0506_023": "They say it causes the senses to overreact.",
    "svo0506_024": "In my case, this interrupts the visual masking effect and causes me to be able\r\nto see object data and the code that makes it work directly.",
    "svo0506_025": "Fuuka told us about that.",
    "svo0506_026": "When she saved Klein from that trap.",
    "svo0506_027": "There is no method of curing these symptoms completely yet.\r\nAnd of course, I can't enjoy playing VR games.",
    "svo0506_028": "But I've been able to experience a lot of things in the Test Room.",
    "svo0506_029": "Apparently, my symptoms allow me to identify bugs and program issues at\r\na glance.",
    "svo0506_030": "And in some cases, I can even identify the root cause.",
    "svo0506_031": "Finding out that I could help people through the condition that had been\r\nholding me back was like a breath of fresh air.",
    "svo0506_032": "And though it's been with the help of Neige and the staff, I've succeeded in\r\ncorrecting bugs and repairing corrupted data several times.",
    "svo0506_033": "They all praised me for solving problems that normally required\r\nhighly-specialized programs and advanced AI.",
    "svo0506_034": "Some even said they wanted me on the team as an engineer instead of a\r\ntest player.",
    "svo0506_035": "Everyone is so kind and passionate about their work. I've always been shy,\r\nbut I think I've found a place I fit in.",
    "svo0506_036": "Every day is so fun and exciting.\r\nI'm so glad I took this job.",
    "svo0506_037": "Aw, how sweet. Except it doesn't do us any damn good.",
    "svo0506_038": "Put a sock in it, Death Gun. There's more.",
    "svo0506_039": "Although there haven't been any major effects yet, the team's research into ways\r\nto counter overfitting has been progressing.",
    "svo0506_040": "One of my responsibilities is wandering the VR world and reporting how it\r\nappears to me.",
    "svo0506_041": "While out on my daily stroll today, I came across a bit of junk data which had\r\nbarely retained a hint of the object it came from.",
    "svo0506_042": "It happens fairly often.\r\nMy eyes perceive digital data directly, whether I intend to or not.",
    "svo0506_043": "Typical players are wading in far more residual data than they realize.\r\nCountless fragments of junk data of all types float surround them at all times.",
    "svo0506_044": "But what stopped me in my tracks was that this time, I heard a faint voice.\r\nIt was asking for my help.",
    "svo0506_045": "But it wasn't quite a voice.",
    "svo0506_046": "It was more like I saw a faint will within the flickering construct.",
    "svo0506_047": "The structure suggested it was originally some kind of character data.",
    "svo0506_048": "Then it hit me: could I repair it?",
    "svo0506_049": "Though I was unsure for a moment, I decided to bring the data back with me.",
    "svo0506_050": "It wasn't that. I was just curious. I felt bad for it.\r\nAs weird as it sounds to feel bad for data.",
    "svo0506_051": "I suppose my thoughts on that point changed after Neige and I became friends.",
    "svo0506_052": "Either that, or I had gotten uncharacteristically optimistic about putting\r\nmy overfitting to use.",
    "svo0506_053": "Either way, I decided to restore the data.\r\nI did everything I could, putting all of my knowledge and skills to use.",
    "svo0506_054": "My condition was normally a burden, but in cases like this it was a blessing\r\nthat showed me exactly where the problems were and how to fix them.",
    "svo0506_055": "And when I couldn't figure it out on my own, I would subtly ask Neige\r\nor the dev staff.",
    "svo0506_056": "They readily answered all of my questions.\r\nI wonder if any of them had realized what I was up to.",
    "svo0506_057": "And so I kept on restoring the character data bit by bit between working hours.",
    "svo0506_058": "Neige. You mentioned that certain portions of your memory from before the\r\nmalfunction had been deleted, did you not?",
    "svo0506_059": "Do you remember this development?",
    "svo0506_060": "No. It's likely that these are the parts that were deleted.",
    "svo0506_061": "Of course, it wasn't easy, even with my ability to read code directly. It was\r\nmy first time repairing such corrupted data, and I ran into many roadblocks.",
    "svo0506_062": "But I was fixated on helping the poor chunk of data.\r\nPlus, I hoped that succeeding would be something I could be proud of.",
    "svo0506_063": "It was as fulfilling as it was arduous.",
    "svo0506_064": "I kept at it until, at last, the character data was fully restored.",
    "svo0506_065": "The character appeared to be a Caucasian male in his late 20s. In addition to a\r\njeweled crown atop his blond head, he wore an extravagant red and black outfit.",
    "svo0506_066": "He looked like a character from a fantasy game. One with a high status,\r\nmaybe a hero or a king. Was he an AI?",
    "svo0506_067": "I cautiously asked him his name. And he answered:",
    "svo0506_068": "Gabriel Miller.",
    "svo0506_069": "...",
    "svo0506_070": "That's as far as the entry goes.",
    "svo0506_071": "That wasn't the name I wanted to hear. So that's where this Gabriel came from.\r\nNow we know how he and Fuuka are connected.",
    "svo0506_072": "So to sum it up, Fuuka found a fragment of Gabriel that was floating as a piece\r\nof data and reconstructed him from it?",
    "svo0506_073": "And gave his digital ghost a body to inhabit.",
    "svo0506_074": "This is certainly an interesting precedent.",
    "svo0506_075": "He was supposed to have been completely destroyed.",
    "svo0506_076": "Even if he did remain somehow as fragments of data...",
    "svo0506_077": "How did those fragments find their way into ALO? And what were the chances that\r\nFuuka would come across them and reconstruct him? It's crazy.",
    "svo0506_078": "I think Fuuka meant well by helping the corrupted data.\r\nHer good intentions seem to have had a less than desirable effect.",
    "svo0506_079": "Neige, might you have any memory at all of this character known as Gabriel?",
    "svo0506_080": "None, sadly.",
    "svo0506_081": "I attempted to recall when you pointed it out to me, but the last thing\r\nI remember is most likely just before Fuuka discovered the junk data.",
    "svo0506_082": "And after that—",
    "svo0506_083": "You find yourself wandering around with Fuuka in this messed up world,\r\nnot remembering a thing. Just before you met us.",
    "svo0506_084": "Yes. But when I saw Fuuka and that man fighting in the dungeon,\r\nI had a feeling that I had met him before.",
    "svo0506_085": "I was terrified, and I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "svo0506_086": "If this record is accurate, does it mean that Fuuka is responsible for the staff\r\nbeing killed?",
    "svo0506_087": "You go through all that to resurrect someone, and they turn out to be an\r\nunstoppable, cold-blooded murderer. Can't think of a worse outcome than that.",
    "svo0506_088": "That's rich coming from you.\r\nBesides, complaining about it now won't fix anything, will it?",
    "svo0506_089": "This entry only has up to the point Gabriel got a body.\r\nI wonder what happened next.",
    "svo0506_090": "Gabriel attacked the staff, Fuuka and Neige ran for their lives\r\nand found Kirito?",
    "svo0506_091": "Even so, there are several points that don't add up.",
    "svo0506_092": "What caused Galaxia to malfunction? Likewise, who triggered it?\r\nAnd for what purpose?",
    "svo0506_093": "In the same vein, we still don't know why Galaxia is in lockdown\r\nor why Neige's memories were erased.",
    "svo0506_094": "What about as a cover up?",
    "svo0506_095": "A c-cover up?",
    "svo0506_096": "Fuuka was afraid of having her big blunder found out and getting blamed,\r\nso she caused the system malfunction as a diversion. She hid her guilt.",
    "svo0506_097": "She doesn't want the system to recover, and she couldn't have Neige let the cat\r\nout of the bag either. So she locked it down and erased her memory.",
    "svo0506_098": "You know it makes sense.\r\nHeh heh heh.",
    "svo0506_099": "It couldn't be.",
    "svo0506_100": "Don't worry. It's just his theory. And not a well-grounded one, either.",
    "svo0506_101": "Assuming the possibility that Fuuka was behind the error,\r\nthere is an equal or greater possibility that it was Gabriel's doing.",
    "svo0506_102": "You need not take it seriously. At least not at this point.",
    "svo0506_103": "Listen, Neige. Is your job right now to worry about this guy's crappy theory\r\nand agonize over it?",
    "svo0506_104": "No. It's to unearth the truth and face the facts.",
    "svo0506_105": "Exactly.",
    "svo0506_106": "There are still more clues to find.\r\nThey'll show us what really happened.",
    "svo0506_107": "We don't have time to sit around overanalyzing.",
    "svo0507_001": "So Neige and Fuuka were involved from the beginning.",
    "svo0507_002": "Yeah. But we still only just learned how this started.\r\nThere's still a lot we don't know.",
    "svo0507_003": "Our mission hasn't changed.",
    "svo0507_004": "We find the guardians that are hiding Fuuka's clues,\r\nand if we encounter Gabriel, we run.",
    "svo0507_005": "Okay?",
    "svo0507_006": "That's a ten-four! Safety first!",
    "svo0507_007": "Fair enough. Let me know if anything changes.",
    "svo0507_008": "I hope this all gets figured out soon.",
    "svo0507_009": "...",
    "svo0507_010": "Are you okay, Liz? It looks like something's bothering you.",
    "svo0507_011": "Huh? Oh, sorry. Just thinking, that's all.",
    "svo0507_012": "If you have something to say, don't hold back.\r\nWe can suggest it to Cardinal and the others.",
    "svo0507_013": "Oh, nothing like that. I'll leave the strategizing to you guys.\r\nI'm no good at that kind of stuff.",
    "svo0507_014": "I was just thinking about Fuuka.",
    "svo0507_015": "What about her?",
    "svo0507_016": "Well, you guys walked into the Test Room and found the staff marked DEAD.",
    "svo0507_017": "And apparently that Gabriel guy was the one who did it. Right?",
    "svo0507_018": "Yeah.",
    "svo0507_019": "I've fought the guy a few times before.\r\nThat monster'd have no problem massacring a room full of people like that.",
    "svo0507_020": "But I thought when you and Asuna tracked her down,\r\nshe told you outright that she did it?",
    "svo0507_021": "Yeah. But if Gabriel was the one who actually did it—",
    "svo0507_022": "She must have been lying.\r\nBut why?",
    "svo0507_023": "Exactly! Why did she have to lie?",
    "svo0507_024": "I don't know. There are a few things about her actions I just can't figure out.",
    "svo0507_025": "Like telling lies that keep us off the mark.",
    "svo0507_026": "And we've been chalking everything else up to her too. Stealing Neige's\r\nmemories, causing the system malfunction, and locking it down.",
    "svo0507_027": "I was with her for a while, and we got to talk a bit.\r\nSomething's not right if you ask me. She didn't seem like that kind of person.",
    "svo0507_028": "She was cheerful, but not the type who would bother or hurt anyone.\r\nAm I giving her too much credit?",
    "svo0507_029": "No. I didn't sense any ill will from her behavior either.",
    "svo0507_030": "Same here. She seemed kinda genuine?",
    "svo0507_031": "Yeah. Well, why don't we brainstorm a bit while we're talking about it?",
    "svo0507_032": "About what?",
    "svo0507_033": "Assuming she did do these things, what reasons would the Fuuka you know have\r\nfor doing them?",
    "svo0507_034": "Oh, like maybe she actually had good intentions?",
    "svo0507_035": "Right. She already has enough people making complicated deductions about why she\r\nwould do something so terrible—I want to approach it from a different angle.",
    "svo0507_036": "Okay then. First of all, why the heck did she say that she was the one who did\r\nit? It makes no sense!",
    "svo0507_037": "Maybe she wanted to protect the actual culprit? That's how it usually goes on\r\nTV, anyway.",
    "svo0507_038": "But the actual culprit is that monster Gabriel.\r\nWhy would she protect him?",
    "svo0507_039": "And another thing, he was trying to attack her. You wouldn't want to go\r\nanywhere near a person like that, never mind protecting him.",
    "svo0507_040": "Hmm. Maybe that's exactly why.",
    "svo0507_041": "I mean, you normally wouldn't want to be around someone who kills people just\r\nfor fun, VR or not.",
    "svo0507_042": "Being close to her carried the risk of running into Gabriel because\r\nhe was targeting her.",
    "svo0507_043": "So you think she wanted to avoid that?",
    "svo0507_044": "She hoped to keep us away from her by naming herself the PKer.",
    "svo0507_045": "But didn't she ask Daddy and Leafa to escort her?\r\nThat seems contradictory.",
    "svo0507_046": "Maybe it was because she needed someone to protect Neige, since she can't fight.",
    "svo0507_047": "She left the party a handful of times too.",
    "svo0507_048": "She was probably scouting around so we wouldn't run into Gabriel\r\nor checking on Galaxia.",
    "svo0507_049": "She probably had a lot to do.",
    "svo0507_050": "But she couldn't leave Neige alone, right?\r\nMaybe that's why she asked us to go with her.",
    "svo0507_051": "Hmm. But why couldn't she just be honest and say someone bad was after her?",
    "svo0507_052": "She probably thought it would do no good and just make everyone panic.",
    "svo0507_053": "I hate to say it, but he's more than we could handle.",
    "svo0507_054": "Oh, okay. When you think about it like this it's easier to see the positive\r\nreasons she might have acted how she did.",
    "svo0507_055": "Although it doesn't exactly prove anything.",
    "svo0507_056": "It's a lot better than just doubting her, though.",
    "svo0507_057": "What's left?\r\nWhy she locked the system down and why she altered Neige's memories?",
    "svo0507_058": "She must've had reasons for that too. Maybe she had to deal with Gabriel?",
    "svo0507_059": "We still don't have anything to go by on that point.\r\nMaybe the next clue will tell us something.",
    "svo0507_060": "So in the end it boils down to finding those guardians again.",
    "svo0507_061": "All right then, let's get a-searchin'!",
    "svo0507_062": "Mommy! There's a group of monsters headed this way!\r\nThey don't seem to have noticed us yet, at least.",
    "svo0507_063": "I'll tell the others. Let's be ready for a fight.",
    "svo0507_064": "And here's the last one! Take this!",
    "svo0507_065": "Wooo! Nice hit!",
    "svo0507_066": "Aww, yeahhh!",
    "svo0507_067": "That's all of them.",
    "svo0507_068": "Phewie, that sure was a doozy.",
    "svo0507_069": "Man, those grenade launchers really pack a punch!\r\nBetter range than a blade too!",
    "svo0507_070": "It'd be great to have one on the party all the time.\r\nI wonder if they'll add 'em to ALO.",
    "svo0507_071": "Bahahaha! Are you kidding me! That'd totally wreck the setting!",
    "svo0507_072": "But I get you. You can't really pop off ranged spells like you can a nice volley\r\nof grenades. I hop into ALO sometimes too.",
    "svo0507_073": "Oh, yeah? What about you, LLENN?",
    "svo0507_074": "Huh? No, just GGO for me.\r\nI had a kind of bad experience with ALO's character creation.",
    "svo0507_075": "O-Oh, yeah? Okay.",
    "svo0507_076": "That reminds me, didn't Sino say this Gabriel guy was a GGO player?",
    "svo0507_077": "Don't tell me you're all GGO pros like him?",
    "svo0507_078": "No way. That guy's got a few screws loose.",
    "svo0507_079": "Me neither. I know some top players and a few weirdos in-game,\r\nbut that guy's not human.",
    "svo0507_080": "You've got that right. *shudder*",
    "svo0507_081": "Since he came from corrupted data that Fuuka repaired,\r\nwe can't really consider him a genuine player.",
    "svo0507_082": "But, yeah, there's something weird about him.\r\nHow did he get that powerful?",
    "svo0507_083": "Alice thought that he could be boosting his abilities through his\r\nself-image, his Incarnation.",
    "svo0507_084": "I think that's highly likely, but it can't be all there is to it.",
    "svo0507_085": "Incarnation?",
    "svo0507_086": "A special ability which is rarely observed in The Seed.",
    "svo0507_087": "Heathcliff.",
    "svo0507_088": "I've cleaned up the monsters on my end. Consider them eradicated.",
    "svo0507_089": "Never mind the monsters, what's this about a special ability?",
    "svo0507_090": "To put it simply, it is the power to affect the world around you and do the\r\nimpossible. In particular, things that exceed the limitations of the system.",
    "svo0507_091": "It is thought to be triggered by intense determination and a strong will,\r\nbut the specific mechanism is not well understood.",
    "svo0507_092": "So that's it? It's some kinda mysterious power? Well, I guess I wouldn't follow\r\nanyway, even if you did lay a bunch of techno-lingo on me.",
    "svo0507_093": "I feel like I saw a lot of it in Underworld though.",
    "svo0507_094": "Kiridude used some crazy sword attacks and flew off with Asuna.",
    "svo0507_095": "So it's like a special move or some kind of super finisher?",
    "svo0507_096": "That is a valid interpretation.",
    "svo0507_097": "While we're here, I want to ask you something. Do you have any ideas on how\r\nwe can deal with Gabriel?",
    "svo0507_098": "I can't imagine it working out if we just tried to pit our own will against his.",
    "svo0507_099": "Indeed.",
    "svo0507_100": "First, we must ascertain the source of his power.",
    "svo0507_101": "As you say, it is possible he is using his self-image.\r\nThe power of his own will.",
    "svo0507_102": "Rather, I suspect that his will is indeed the origin.",
    "svo0507_103": "If so, what kind of will formed the core of his Incarnation? His urge to kill?",
    "svo0507_104": "A fair point. Let us assume so for now.",
    "svo0507_105": "He called himself \"one who robs.\"",
    "svo0507_106": "By that he probably meant lives and souls, huh?",
    "svo0507_107": "Most likely.",
    "svo0507_108": "He sees us not as fellow humans, but believes himself to be the hunter,\r\nand we the prey.",
    "svo0507_109": "I don't like the sound of that.",
    "svo0507_110": "In other words, he recognizes himself as a superior being.\r\nIn the current situation, I think he might actually be right.",
    "svo0507_111": "But is believing really all it takes to get that kind of power?",
    "svo0507_112": "And even prey fights back when attacked.\r\nThe hunter doesn't always win.",
    "svo0507_113": "In fact, he's experienced defeat and been injured multiple times.\r\nThat means his will can't make him invincible.",
    "svo0507_114": "Alice and Eugeo gave it some thought too, but this is about as far as they got.",
    "svo0507_115": "I dunno if you have to get too complicated with it.\r\nDidn't something go wrong with that, uh, whachamacallit system?",
    "svo0507_116": "You mean Galaxia?",
    "svo0507_117": "Yeah, that. Doesn't that pretty much mean that anything could happen?",
    "svo0507_118": "With the world this messed up, this Gabriel guy being waaay stronger\r\nthan he should be isn't that hard to believe.",
    "svo0507_119": "You've got a simple way of seeing things, Klein.\r\nOh, I don't mean in a bad way.",
    "svo0507_120": "You kind of see outside the box. I'm a little jealous.",
    "svo0507_121": "That's right! I'm an open-minded kinda guy who doesn't fret over details!",
    "svo0507_122": "Well that is your strong suit, Klein. But still—",
    "svo0507_123": "Even with the system going haywire, it's not like anything goes.\r\nThere have to be rules.",
    "svo0507_124": "I get the feeling there's something more logical behind it.",
    "svo0507_125": "I agree. For now, let's isolate the problem.",
    "svo0507_126": "I believe the merging of the worlds and Gabriel Miller's incredible power\r\nwere caused by two separate events.",
    "svo0507_127": "What's your reasoning?",
    "svo0507_128": "As you said, a system malfunction alone is not enough to make the impossible\r\npossible.",
    "svo0507_129": "With this assumption, you could say you don't yet have an explanation for the\r\ncurrent chaos.",
    "svo0507_130": "The reason is because this phenomenon transcends the limits of a FullDive\r\nsystem, including Galaxia.",
    "svo0507_131": "Huh. You don't say.",
    "svo0507_132": "Hm? So are you saying that you have an explanation for Gabriel's power?",
    "svo0507_133": "Did you figure something out?",
    "svo0507_134": "It's no more than a theory. But would you care to hear it?",
    "svo0508_001": "Let us consider it from a different angle.",
    "svo0508_002": "Gabriel seems to derive pleasure from the act of killing.\r\nHowever, this reality is only virtual.",
    "svo0508_003": "Even should one's HP drop to zero in the game, that would normally have no\r\neffect on the physical body in The Real World.",
    "svo0508_004": "VR worlds are inherently safe spaces.",
    "svo0508_005": "Funny hearing that from you.\r\nI have a lot I could say, but we'll put a pin in it for now. Go on.",
    "svo0508_006": "Thank you.",
    "svo0508_007": "Now, how can it be that he is able to enjoy the act of killing in a world\r\nwithout death?",
    "svo0508_008": "Well, because it's realistic?",
    "svo0508_009": "You told me before that death in such a real-to-life world might have an effect\r\non the physical body.",
    "svo0508_010": "In other words, the act of killing also feels real. Is that right?\r\nLike in Underworld, for example.",
    "svo0508_011": "Precisely. Except that gives rise to the next question:",
    "svo0508_012": "This is not Underworld. It is a casual VR world open to the general population.\r\nSo why has death become so real in this place?",
    "svo0508_013": "We heard about that from Fuuka's log.\r\nIt's because this world is under the influence of Galaxia.",
    "svo0508_014": "Galaxia lets you experience memories of your past with others. It reproduces\r\nsensations and emotions so realistically, it's like they're happening again.",
    "svo0508_015": "That part is still working even though the system malfunctioned, right?",
    "svo0508_016": "She said they made a system that turns the smallest sensations and emotions\r\ninto data and makes it all hyper-realistic.",
    "svo0508_017": "Meaning that the variety and quantity of signals between the VR device\r\nand brain are vastly higher than normal levels.",
    "svo0508_018": "Put another way, the user's brain must be made to receive this dramatically\r\nincreased quantity of data. That is where the essence of Galaxia lies.",
    "svo0508_019": "In short, by making the user more susceptible to the transmission of objective\r\ninformation at ultra high resolutions...",
    "svo0508_020": "...the system is able to influence the user's consciousness.",
    "svo0508_021": "Uh? In English now?",
    "svo0508_022": "Hmm. Give me a moment.",
    "svo0508_023": "For example, let us say there is a VR world in which you are moved by the view\r\nof a beautiful sunset.",
    "svo0508_024": "Pfft. That doesn't sound like the Klein I know.",
    "svo0508_025": "Can it, Argo. And?",
    "svo0508_026": "The image of a beautiful sunset is projected into your brain and you,\r\nseeing that sunset, are moved by it. This is what happens in conventional VR.",
    "svo0508_027": "By contrast, Galaxia functions fundamentally different. Rather than showing you\r\na sunset, it uploads the experience of a sunset directly to your brain.",
    "svo0508_028": "It strips away boundaries of the consciousness—ego, the subject, self\r\nawareness—and facilitates the injection of external data into the mind.",
    "svo0508_029": "Manipulating someone's sense of self...\r\nIs that possible?",
    "svo0508_030": "There have been attempts in the past to supplement or reconstruct an entity's\r\nego by way of external data.",
    "svo0508_031": "That's what saved my life while I was in Underworld.\r\nThe Ordinal Scale Incident is another example.",
    "svo0508_032": "Ah, yes. The restoration of Yuna Shigemura's personality.\r\nIt does not seem to have been 100% successful.",
    "svo0508_033": "As for Galaxia, I doubt it was intended for such a dramatic case.",
    "svo0508_034": "That said, for the subjective to become objective, sustained transmission of\r\nexternal data into the mind will have an effect. The boundary between blurs.",
    "svo0508_035": "The result is an environment tuned to the sum of this data. One which is easy\r\nto identify and sympathize with. That is the secret to Galaxia's realism.",
    "svo0508_036": "Question, Professor!",
    "svo0508_037": "Yes, Miss Fukaziroh?",
    "svo0508_038": "I just want to make sure, but this external data you mentioned includes not only\r\nthe things that I saw or heard...",
    "svo0508_039": "...but everything that anyone else felt or thought, too?\r\nAnd that affects my mind.",
    "svo0508_040": "Correct.",
    "svo0508_041": "So, the reason I thought I was an SAO player was—",
    "svo0508_042": "Because of the Galaxia system.",
    "svo0508_043": "Oh yeah, Asuna told me about that.",
    "svo0508_044": "Nautilus—I mean, Eiji—thought he was back in SAO and he sucked Asuna into the\r\ndelusion with him.",
    "svo0508_045": "And then Fuka too.",
    "svo0508_046": "Yes. False perceptions propagate between hosts in what Cardinal calls \"cognitive\r\ncontamination.\" It is all too easy to lose sight of reality in this place.",
    "svo0508_047": "Oh, and for the record, technologies making use of digitized experiences are\r\nperfectly legitimate.",
    "svo0508_048": "From pictures and the written word to photographs and video, technologies for\r\nrecording and sharing information have been instrumental to civilization.",
    "svo0508_049": "This is because they serve to transmit knowledge to future generations.",
    "svo0508_050": "In the case of Galaxia, the version to be deployed would surely have had a\r\nnumber of built-in safety measures to protect users from any negative effects.",
    "svo0508_051": "But then somebody shows up with bad intentions, and this happens.",
    "svo0508_052": "Exactly.",
    "svo0508_053": "Now, this has been quite a long digression.\r\nLet us get back to the subject at hand—Gabriel.",
    "svo0508_054": "I get it now.\r\nThe will driving his strength isn't just a desire for power.",
    "svo0508_055": "What is it then?",
    "svo0508_056": "What he wants is a world where he can kill.\r\nA world where he can taste the souls of his victims for real.",
    "svo0508_057": "*shudder* Just hearing you say it gives me the creeps!",
    "svo0508_058": "That mental image, along with what Galaxia can do, has made death real here.",
    "svo0508_059": "Which reminds me. Fuuka said \"Gabriel kills, so he can kill.\"",
    "svo0508_060": "I think I finally understand what's so terrifying about that.",
    "svo0508_061": "Uh? Not sure I follow.",
    "svo0508_062": "Gabriel attacks someone.\r\nThat person suffers lifelike terror and recognizes him as the bringer of death.",
    "svo0508_063": "Then that perception jumps into Gabriel himself, boosting his self-image.",
    "svo0508_064": "The cycle repeats, with each new victim's fear amplifying his power until\r\nhe becomes the perfect god of death.",
    "svo0508_065": "So what you're sayin' is he's so strong because people're scared of him.",
    "svo0508_066": "And the more they fear him, the stronger he'll get?",
    "svo0508_067": "That's right.",
    "svo0508_068": "And to make matters even worse, the fear spreads from his victims to the players\r\nwho are still alive.",
    "svo0508_069": "That only cements his self-identity further.",
    "svo0508_070": "A cycle fed by the principles of the world and the will within it.\r\nThe effects must be massive.",
    "svo0508_071": "Wow. Exponentially replicating fear? That's no joke.\r\nIs there anything we can even do?",
    "svo0508_072": "I believe there is.",
    "svo0508_073": "For real?!",
    "svo0508_074": "And a very simple thing at that.\r\nAll we have to do is to not fear him.",
    "svo0508_075": "When we come to face Gabriel, if we refuse to fear him, remove the notion of\r\ndefeat from our minds, those thoughts will in turn manifest in his self-image.",
    "svo0508_076": "And he'll lose his power as the bringer of death.",
    "svo0508_077": "Precisely. To what extent is uncertain, but the gap between his strength\r\nand ours is sure to narrow.",
    "svo0508_078": "Sounds good, but asking us to feel no fear in a world with hyper-realistic death\r\nis a tall order.",
    "svo0508_079": "I get your reasoning, but—",
    "svo0508_080": "Are you guys wimpin' out on me? All we gotta do is be fearless!\r\nPiece o' cake!",
    "svo0508_081": "There're times for putting on a brave face,\r\nbut I think this'll take more than that.",
    "svo0508_082": "Hey, I'm not just puttin' on a brave face!",
    "svo0508_083": "I, for one, would be brave enough to pull out my sword right now\r\nif that son of a—",
    "svo0508_084": "Uh, Klein? Behind you.",
    "svo0508_085": "Agwuh?!",
    "svo0508_086": "My, such strong leg muscles.",
    "svo0508_087": "Charlotte. Did something happen?",
    "svo0508_088": "I have a message from Cardinal. She wishes you all to investigate a strange\r\nreaction she detected in the nearby area.",
    "svo0508_089": "Could it be a guardian?",
    "svo0508_090": "Quite likely.",
    "svo0508_091": "Understood. Do you have the exact coordinates?",
    "svo0508_092": "At the edge of the GGO world we are currently in.\r\nI'll take you when you're ready.",
    "svo0508_093": "Gabriel could show up at any moment, so we don't have much time, right?",
    "svo0508_094": "That's what I wanted to hear!\r\nLet's get ourselves ready and take out that guardian!",
    "svo0508_095": "That mighta been a cool line if ya didn't look like an idiot.",
    "svo0508_096": "This looks like GGO too.",
    "svo0508_097": "Of the several worlds based on GGO so far,\r\nevery one of them has been barren and desolate.",
    "svo0508_098": "Looking upon such emptiness feels so...",
    "svo0508_099": "Comforting.",
    "svo0508_100": "...",
    "svo0508_101": "...",
    "svo0508_102": "Huh? Did I say something weird?",
    "svo0508_103": "Oh, right. You're both ALO players.",
    "svo0508_104": "Um, it's not that I like desolate wastelands or anything, it's just familiar.",
    "svo0508_105": "GGO's your only game, right?",
    "svo0508_106": "Yeah. I haven't been playing for long, but the sight of the wastes and the\r\ndeserts and the run down buildings is kinda relaxing.",
    "svo0508_107": "It feels like home, GGO.",
    "svo0508_108": "But I always feel most at home with Little Miss P.",
    "svo0508_109": "Little Miss P?",
    "svo0508_110": "My trusty partner here.",
    "svo0508_111": "I see. I understand well the comfort offered by a familiar weapon.\r\nOne that can give you strength in even the most dire of situations.",
    "svo0508_112": "Me too.",
    "svo0508_113": "She even cheers me up when I'm in a pinch,\r\nand gives me hints on how to beat the bad guys!",
    "svo0508_114": "Hm? Gives you, hints?",
    "svo0508_115": "She can be a little bit of a blabbermouth and swears a lot sometimes,\r\nbut hearing her voice always helps me push through!",
    "svo0508_116": "O-Oh? Yeah.",
    "svo0508_117": "(She must mean that figuratively.\r\nI HOPE she means that figuratively.)",
    "svo0508_118": "I can be pretty timid and introverted, so I can't let myself hold you guys b—",
    "svo0508_119": "LLENN, get down!",
    "svo0508_120": "Huh? Eep!",
    "svo0508_121": "Th-There it is!",
    "svo0508_122": "The guardian!",
    "svo0508_123": "Holy hand grenades, it's huge! And scary! Nope!\r\nNope nope nope!",
    "svo0508_124": "I can't beat this thing!",
    "svo0508_124_2": "Change in plan: let's bait and trap it!",
    "svo0508_125": "I'll distract it. You two find an opening and hit it from the rear!",
    "svo0508_126": "Worry about avoiding its attacks! We made a racket, so the others will be here soon!\r\nThis is really scary, but let's hold on until they arrive to fight!",
    "svo0508_127": "R-Roger that!",
    "svo0508_128": "What happened to timid and introverted?\r\nNever mind, understood!",
    "svo0508_129": "They're already fighting? Come on, let's get in there!",
    "svo0508_130": "There has been a terrible incident.\r\nI will record what happened as best I can below.",
    "svo0508_131": "A few days ago I succeeded in restoring the corrupted character data\r\nI had found.",
    "svo0508_132": "I was elated.",
    "svo0508_133": "At the time, I likely felt a sense of fulfillment akin to having rescued\r\nan injured animal.",
    "svo0508_134": "He—Gabriel Miller—rarely speaks and shows no signs of emotion.\r\nHe doesn't seem particularly hostile either. Could he be a generic NPC?",
    "svo0508_135": "Then again, his outfit would indicate he is a character of some importance.",
    "svo0508_136": "There are some hardcore players among the staff.\r\nMaybe they know something about him?",
    "svo0508_137": "I attempted to report the results of my work by introducing him to the staff.",
    "svo0508_138": "And then it happened.",
    "svo0508_139": "I prefer not to recall the events that followed.",
    "svo0508_140": "Gabriel casually walked up to one of the staff and grabbed them by the throat.",
    "svo0508_141": "It made a cracking noise.",
    "svo0508_142": "He looked back at the other staff who had crumpled to the floor\r\nand slowly drew his sword.",
    "svo0508_143": "This is a Test Room on the ALO server.\r\nIt's a virtual world, so no one can actually die, of course.",
    "svo0508_144": "And yet, though it should have been impossible—",
    "svo0508_145": "Suddenly, the concept of death became terribly real,\r\nand a horrifying notion came over the room. We were all going to die.",
    "svo0508_146": "What followed was utter panic.",
    "svo0508_147": "Amidst the chaos of shouting voices and screams,\r\nI desperately ran and hid behind a desk in the corner of the Test Room.",
    "svo0508_148": "\"Now comes the best part.\"\r\n\"I wonder what your soul will taste like?\"",
    "svo0508_149": "He kept muttering, almost humming to himself as he meandered around the room.",
    "svo0508_150": "His face was empty, emotionless... But his eyes alone flickered with a strange\r\nlight as they hunted me.",
    "svo0508_151": "What I saw in them was pure desire and obsession.\r\nThese were the eyes of a hungry predator stalking its prey.",
    "svo0508_152": "\"They're all dead. I'm going to die now too.\r\nMy fate is sealed.\"",
    "svo0508_153": "For some reason, my mind was overcome with such thoughts. \r\nRealizing that I was losing my capacity for rational judgment, I racked my brain as hard as I could.",
    "svo0508_154": "What can I do? Is there anything I can do to help this situation?",
    "svo0508_155": "What about Neige? Is she okay?\r\nIf I can meet up with her, maybe she'll have a plan.",
    "svo0508_156": "That's all for this entry.",
    "svo0508_157": "Of course, it would end in another cliffhanger.\r\nThis tells us nothing about how to defeat Gabriel.",
    "svo0508_158": "I-I'm sorry.",
    "svo0508_159": "There is no need for you to apologize.\r\nBesides, it is not as if we have gained nothing from this.",
    "svo0508_160": "For one, we have ascertained that the culprit behind the murders was Gabriel,\r\nand cleared Fuuka of any wrongdoing.",
    "svo0508_161": "Yes, that's great news!",
    "svo0508_162": "The suspicions about Fuuka came from the Test Room access logs.",
    "svo0508_163": "I've checked the logs myself.",
    "svo0508_164": "It is true that the only person inside who was safe was Fuuka.\r\nEveryone else had the DEAD status. However—",
    "svo0508_165": "It was Gabriel who did the deed. And since he's a construct made from the data\r\nFuuka found, it makes sense that there's no record of him entering the room.",
    "svo0508_166": "Right.",
    "svo0508_167": "So it's likely that Heathcliff's theory was right.",
    "svo0508_168": "Gabriel is capable of boosting the realism of death to levels indistinguishable\r\nfrom The Real World.",
    "svo0508_169": "Judging from Fuuka's description, we can assume that everyone in the room\r\nentered an extreme state of panic induced by fear.",
    "svo0508_170": "Since they reacted as if they had been attacked in The Real World,\r\nthey forgot to even try to log out.",
    "svo0508_171": "It seems we've moved another step toward uncovering the truth.",
    "svo0508_172": "What use is one little step, Kayaba?\r\nWhat we need is something that will turn this entire situation on its head.",
    "svo0508_173": "I don't expect we'd be punished for having such high expectations of a clue,\r\nconsidering we've been told to gather them.",
    "svo0508_174": "Will this man's complaints ever cease?",
    "svo0508_175": "Something to turn the situation on its head, huh?",
    "svo0508_176": "Well, come to think of it, you two got away somehow.\r\nYou wouldn't have met us if you didn't.",
    "svo0508_177": "You must have took some drastic measures against Gabriel.\r\nAnd they must have worked. Do you remember anything like that?",
    "svo0508_178": "No.\r\nI'm sorry.",
    "svo0508_179": "Oh, well.",
    "svo0508_180": "Hmm.",
    "svo0508_181": "Something bothering you?",
    "svo0508_182": "Well, something to that effect. Still—",
    "svo0508_183": "No, I'll save it. This isn't the time.",
    "svo0508_184": "Hmph. Playing the detective now, are we?",
    "svo0508_185": "Not exactly.\r\nBut there are things that you shouldn't say until you can prove them.",
    "svo0508_186": "For now, let's track down that last clue.\r\nIt might give us something conclusive.",
    "svo0508_187": "I'm not sure about that. \r\nI have a feeling we'd be better off spending that time and resources on something more worthwhile.",
    "svo0508_188": "Um, can I have a moment?",
    "svo0508_189": "What is it? Did you remember something?",
    "svo0508_190": "N-No. I just had an idea.",
    "svo0508_191": "Think twice before you say it. If it's not worth hearing—",
    "svo0508_192": "Don't you worry about what this loser has to say.",
    "svo0508_193": "Go on, Neige. We're listening!",
    "svo0508_194": "Okay. I think we should focus everything on finding the final clue.",
    "svo0508_195": "And why do you think so?",
    "svo0508_196": "It might sound crazy, but...",
    "svo0508_197": "I think it's because the contents of the final clue can bring her back to life.",
    "svo0509_001": "Reviving Fuuka? For real?",
    "svo0509_002": "Reviving her would resolve many of the problems plaguing us,\r\nbut is such a thing possible?",
    "svo0509_003": "I know of worlds where such power exists, but even so, it is hard to believe.",
    "svo0509_004": "But we haven't found any way in here to bring someone back to life.\r\nWhy are we talking about this? Kazuto?",
    "svo0509_005": "Uh, well, let's hear her out.\r\nGo on, Neige.",
    "svo0509_006": "Okay.",
    "svo0509_007": "There was something that bothered me. Maybe you noticed too.",
    "svo0509_008": "The avatars of the players who died here never disappeared. They are still here.\r\nBut—",
    "svo0509_009": "But Fuuka's did.",
    "svo0509_010": "That it did.",
    "svo0509_011": "Among the many uncertainties we've encountered in this world,\r\nI hadn't given it much thought.",
    "svo0509_012": "But wouldn't you think that since her avatar is the only one that disappeared\r\nthat makes it even more likely that she's—You know...",
    "svo0509_013": "Even if there were some kind of revival spell,\r\nwe can't cast it without a target, right?",
    "svo0509_014": "That was also what I thought at first.\r\nBut then I remembered what she said just before she disappeared:",
    "svo0509_015": "She said she cast a spell.",
    "svo0509_016": "I kept wondering, what kind of spell? On what?",
    "svo0509_017": "Until eventually it clicked.",
    "svo0509_018": "Our biggest problem right now is that Galaxia is locked down. And that the key\r\nto unlock it is Fuuka Natsuyagi's voiceprint and brainwave pattern.",
    "svo0509_019": "Meaning without her, we can't get access.",
    "svo0509_020": "I don't know why she locked the system down,\r\nbut maybe it was as a way to deal with Gabriel.",
    "svo0509_021": "She couldn't have intended to strand the other players here forever.",
    "svo0509_022": "But on the other hand, as long as Gabriel was hunting her down,\r\nthere was a chance she would be killed here and be trapped.",
    "svo0509_023": "I believe that was the reason for her spell.",
    "svo0509_024": "But what did it do?",
    "svo0509_025": "It's likely that she set it up so that if her HP hit zero...",
    "svo0509_026": "...her avatar would be teleported somewhere else.",
    "svo0509_027": "It's true that ALO has a system where if you die you get teleported back to your home point, but how would that be enough to avoid Gabriel's ability?",
    "svo0509_028": "And I thought the user's minds back in The Real World would be in danger\r\nbecause the fear and experience of death was too real?",
    "svo0509_029": "Since she knew that ahead of time, maybe she avoided it by causing\r\nherself to black out before the fear consumed her.",
    "svo0509_030": "Hmm. That makes sense. With the Galaxia system it might be doable.",
    "svo0509_031": "I would appreciate if you two could explain in a way I can understand.\r\nIf you don't mind.",
    "svo0509_032": "Oh, sorry. Let's see.",
    "svo0509_033": "We're thinking that she escaped just before her Life ran out by entering\r\na suspended state and transporting herself somewhere else.",
    "svo0509_034": "I see. She accepted a kind of death,\r\nknowing it would leave us a way to bring her back.",
    "svo0509_035": "That would also explain why her body disappeared.",
    "svo0509_036": "Exactly. Wouldn't that be what her \"spell\" was?",
    "svo0509_037": "It was probably a last resort.\r\nShe was forced to leave her resurrection in someone else's hands.",
    "svo0509_038": "That someone else being us.",
    "svo0509_039": "So I'm thinking, what if we figure out how to bring her back when we find the last clue?!",
    "svo0509_040": "Then again, I've got no proof that I'm right.\r\nCould this just be wishful thinking?",
    "svo0509_041": "No, I believe it's worth exploring. \r\nIf we can bring her back, talk to her, and properly join forces, that's for the best.",
    "svo0509_042": "Maybe we could even figure out a way to fight back against Gabriel once she tells us just what is going on!",
    "svo0509_043": "Ah, yes, but I do believe we have a formidable opponent to deal with first.",
    "svo0509_044": "Lady Pontifex.",
    "svo0509_045": "Some of you scouted ahead, right?\r\nWhat are we dealing with?",
    "svo0509_046": "How do I put it? It's vexing that it's being used with such impunity.\r\nIt's a strange feeling, I must say.",
    "svo0509_047": "Boy, I believe you and Alice will be familiar with this particular foe.",
    "svo0509_048": "Oh? Is it some kind of beast from Underworld?",
    "svo0509_049": "You'll see.\r\nIn any case, we've no alternative but to fight it.",
    "svo0509_050": "I'd not seen its like.",
    "svo0509_051": "Did a quick recon. One or two shots are unlikely to do much.",
    "svo0509_052": "Its defense is probably high, but more so than that,\r\nit looked like its attacks would hurt a lot.",
    "svo0509_053": "Could you elaborate?",
    "svo0509_054": "Well, it just looked really sharp.",
    "svo0509_055": "See for yourself. You can see it from there.",
    "svo0509_056": "Kirito.",
    "svo0509_057": "Yeah. It's that thing from Central Cathedral, \r\nthe Sword Golem!",
    "svo0509_058": "Damn. And we have to take that thing out somehow.",
    "svo0509_059": "That was one weird lookin' monster, though.",
    "svo0509_060": "Indeed. Kirito called it a Sword Golem, right?",
    "svo0509_061": "I don't remember seeing anything like that in either SAO or ALO.\r\nI wonder if it's from some other game.",
    "svo0509_062": "It was all swords. Literally a bunch of swords thrown together.\r\nThe designer that came up with that must be a nut.",
    "svo0509_063": "You think so?",
    "svo0509_064": "It struck me as the pure manifestation of aggression.\r\nIt's quite exhilarating.",
    "svo0509_065": "Always clever, Quinella. That's pretty well put.",
    "svo0509_066": "Good grief, Klein.",
    "svo0509_067": "Don't you have anything to say?",
    "svo0509_068": "About the Sword Golem you just defeated?\r\nNot in particular.",
    "svo0509_069": "As if I'd feel any kind of attachment to that pale imitation.",
    "svo0509_070": "Or perhaps, did you wish for me to express some pangs of conscience or regret\r\nabout \"that\"?",
    "svo0509_071": "No. Even if you had had any thoughts about it,\r\nI wouldn't expect you to say anything.",
    "svo0509_072": "Wise of you.\r\nMore importantly, are you sure you should be spending your precious time on me?",
    "svo0509_073": "Oh, yeah. The last clue should've dropped just—",
    "svo0509_074": "...",
    "svo0509_075": "Courage—",
    "svo0509_076": "Wh-What? You're—",
    "svo0509_077": "(What just happened?)",
    "svo0509_078": "I don't see it anywhere.",
    "svo0509_079": "Hmm. They always dropped right in front of us before.\r\nWhat's going on?",
    "svo0509_080": "Wait. So, was this just a random boss that appeared\r\nand not one of Fuuka's Guardians?",
    "svo0509_081": "Could be. We just have to keep on look—",
    "svo0509_082": "Um!",
    "svo0509_083": "Is everything okay, Neige?",
    "svo0509_084": "Did none of you see that vision just now?",
    "svo0509_085": "What vision?",
    "svo0509_086": "What are you talking about?",
    "svo0509_087": "You say you saw yourself appear, say something, and then vanish?",
    "svo0509_088": "Yes. Something about courage.",
    "svo0509_089": "It was likely a video set up in advance, most likely by Fuuka,\r\nto play for someone in particular.",
    "svo0509_090": "Well, unfortunately, I'm drawing a total blank.\r\nI have no idea what that was for or what it could've meant.",
    "svo0509_091": "And you found no other data that might be one of Fuuka's clues?",
    "svo0509_092": "Nope. The only reward we got for beating the Guardian\r\nseems to be the video Neige saw.",
    "svo0509_093": "We've defeated all four Guardians.\r\nLet's assume the spell worked as it should.",
    "svo0509_094": "Would it not be safe to assume Fuuka resurrected somewhere?",
    "svo0509_095": "Hmm. I'm still searching.",
    "svo0509_096": "But if she had, wouldn't she have explained that in her message to Neige?",
    "svo0509_097": "It makes little sense for this to conclude with some kind of riddle.",
    "svo0509_098": "Definitely...",
    "svo0509_099": "Did anything change for you, Neige?\r\nDid you remember something else or gain some new ability?",
    "svo0509_100": "No, nothing.",
    "svo0509_101": "This can't be right.",
    "svo0509_102": "There's no way for us to access the Galaxia system without Fuuka's help.",
    "svo0509_103": "This can't be the end of the road.\r\nHer spell has to be a way for us to bring her back from the dead.",
    "svo0509_104": "Are we missing something?\r\nIs there some other condition for reviving her that we haven't figured out?",
    "svo0509_105": "Or did I mess up somewhere along the way?",
    "svo0509_106": "We're all doing our best to analyze the system and formulate\r\ncountermeasures for Gabriel.",
    "svo0509_107": "We may yet discover something new as we proceed.\r\nYou need not put so much pressure on yourself, Neige.",
    "svo0509_108": "You're right.",
    "svo0509_109": "...",
    "svo0509_110": "I see the gears in your head have been turning, Kirito.\r\nHave they borne any fruit?",
    "svo0509_111": "I guess you could say so, yeah. But—",
    "svo0509_112": "Are you hesitant to share?\r\nOr can't you find the words?",
    "svo0509_113": "Perhaps a bit of both?",
    "svo0509_114": "You're very perceptive.",
    "svo0509_115": "After how long we've been together and all we've been through,\r\nit's not so hard to read you.",
    "svo0509_116": "I don't think now is the time to show reserve with our thoughts.\r\nIf you have something to say, best let it be heard.",
    "svo0509_117": "Maybe if I were you—",
    "svo0509_118": "I'd be able to come out and say it,\r\nno matter how difficult or cruel it might be.",
    "svo0509_119": "But I'm not.\r\nI can't move forward without getting lost and taking detours left and right.",
    "svo0509_120": "...",
    "svo0509_121": "Hey, Neige.",
    "svo0509_122": "Y-Yes?!",
    "svo0509_123": "I'm not especially strong.\r\nWhen something scares me, I get the urge to turn tail and run.",
    "svo0509_124": "But you know what?",
    "svo0509_125": "By accepting that weakness, I am able to become stronger.",
    "svo0509_126": "Kirito, I-I'm not sure what you're trying to say.",
    "svo0509_127": "I think I can explain what she—\r\nWhat Fuuka was thinking.",
    "svo0509_128": "Only thing is, I don't think it's going to be what you want to hear.\r\nWill you still hear me out?",
    "svo0509_129": "Yes. Please, tell me.",
    "svo0509_130": "Okay.",
    "svo0509_131": "First, let's talk about the three document files we got from defeating\r\nthe Guardians.",
    "svo0509_132": "Whoa, what?",
    "svo0509_133": "From outside?",
    "svo0509_134": "From here, that's familiar terrain.",
    "svo0509_135": "But it's weird knowing it's not the real ALO.\r\nI can't relax.",
    "svo0509_136": "And you probably shouldn't, either.\r\nWe're supposed to be keeping watch.",
    "svo0509_137": "That's right! Keep your head in the game, Klein!",
    "svo0509_138": "I-I know, jeez.",
    "svo0509_139": "Although, it would be nice if we made some progress soon.",
    "svo0509_140": "Cardinal and the others are trying to figure out the clues, right?\r\nHopefully they'll put something together soon.",
    "svo0509_141": "Yeah. If we could get back to our world ASAP that'd be great.",
    "svo0509_142": "Neige's been tormenting herself ever since Fuuka disappeared.\r\nI'm worried about her.",
    "svo0509_143": "Kirito's with her, and I'm sure he's looking out for her.",
    "svo0509_144": "Yeah. He's weirdly good at that sort of thing.\r\nIt seems rather complicated.",
    "svo0509_145": "We can only do so much.\r\nWe'll swap out when the searching party gets back and—",
    "svo0509_146": "Chirp!",
    "svo0509_147": "Hm? What's wrong, Pina?",
    "svo0509_148": "Hey, Silica, are those—?",
    "svo0509_149": "Eep! M-Monsters?! There are so many...",
    "svo0509_150": "It's more than just monsters. That's—",
    "svo0509_151": "Guys, hear me out! We've got, uh, a visitor!",
    "svo0509_152": "What? Is it Fuuka? Is she back?",
    "svo0509_153": "No! It's Gabriel! That bastard's attacking.\r\nAnd he brought a slew of monsters along for the ride!",
    "svo0509_154": "Hmm. Perhaps he's using fear to manipulate them.",
    "svo0509_155": "So it's a tactic to capitalize on the special qualities\r\nof Emperor Vecta, the ruler of Dark Territory.",
    "svo0509_156": "In any case, it seems we're out of time.\r\nWhat's your move, Kirito?",
    "svo0509_157": "Cardinal, you said you were working on a way to fight Gabriel.\r\nAnything we can use?",
    "svo0509_158": "I don't think so.\r\nI'm afraid all measures are still at the conceptualization and trial phase.",
    "svo0509_159": "Then, we're out of options.\r\nI'll have to go out and face him.",
    "svo0509_160": "Kirito, you're not seriously thinking of fighting him by yourself, are you?",
    "svo0509_161": "No. Even I'm not about to be that reckless.",
    "svo0509_162": "Then, what are you going to do? Did you think of something?",
    "svo0509_163": "I have an idea. Though, it's not something I can whip up right away.",
    "svo0509_164": "For now, I'm going to try and buy us time until the search party gets back.",
    "svo0510_001": "Hey, Gabriel Miller!",
    "svo0510_002": "Did you come all this way for a chat?\r\nWe couldn't have been that easy to find.",
    "svo0510_003": "It wasn't that hard. It was worth the joy of seeing you all.",
    "svo0510_004": "I'm surprised you decided to just stroll on up.\r\nI don't recall you being this polite before.",
    "svo0510_005": "It wouldn't have made a difference whether I made a frontal assault\r\nor snuck up behind you.",
    "svo0510_006": "Awful confident, aren't you? Don't get too comfortable now.\r\nMight get the rug pulled out from under you.",
    "svo0510_007": "Save your breath and show me instead.",
    "svo0510_008": "Eek!",
    "svo0510_009": "Br-Breathe.",
    "svo0510_010": "Maintain focus! You mustn't allow yourselves to be overwhelmed!",
    "svo0510_011": "Oh.\r\nA.L.I.C.E.",
    "svo0510_012": "...",
    "svo0510_013": "Get behind us, you two.\r\nRemain calm and remember to breathe.",
    "svo0510_014": "Thanks, Alice! Eugeo!",
    "svo0510_015": "(Alice's group is back?)",
    "svo0510_016": "(As usual, Gabriel's presence sucks the air out of the room.)",
    "svo0510_017": "(But why hasn't he attacked us yet?\r\nIs he playing with us or is he after something else?)",
    "svo0510_018": "(Either way, if this means we can buy more time, I'm fine with it.\r\nOnce everyone's together, then maybe—)",
    "svo0510_019": "How did you find this place?\r\nI don't think any of us would be that easy to follow.",
    "svo0510_020": "Right now, you're not only the biggest force in the world,\r\nbut you're also conducting the most organized search.",
    "svo0510_021": "Traces of battles against monsters. Unlocked gates between boss monster areas.\r\nContacting other players to gather information.",
    "svo0510_022": "Tracking these things revealed your area of operation,\r\nand I determined your base must be at the center of it all.",
    "svo0510_023": "Anything else I can enlighten you on?",
    "svo0510_024": "Why murder Fuuka and the staff members?\r\nWhy have you done these terrible things?!",
    "svo0510_025": "Hm. Now that you put me on the spot, it's a tricky question to answer.",
    "svo0510_026": "The more detailed my explanation, the further we get from the essence.\r\nIt's an exceedingly difficult sensation to put into words.",
    "svo0510_027": "But I were to hazard it—",
    "svo0510_028": "It's because that is what my heart yearns for.\r\nI have a ravenous desire to know what souls taste like.",
    "svo0510_029": "I exist only to savor them. I always have. I always will.",
    "svo0510_030": "Now, let's see. What do your souls taste like?",
    "svo0510_031": "...",
    "svo0510_032": "Don't bother, Neige.\r\nThere's no point in understanding what he's saying, nor do we need to.\r\nThis is who he is.",
    "svo0510_033": "One who seeks, steals, and robs.\r\nThat's how you described yourself when we first met, wasn't it, Gabriel?",
    "svo0510_034": "I'm guessing that much hasn't changed.",
    "svo0510_035": "You think so?",
    "svo0510_036": "No, no, it has, swordsman Kirito.\r\nMy craving for souls has grown tremendously.",
    "svo0510_037": "Thanks to this new life I was given,\r\nI gained the ability to make virtual death extremely real.",
    "svo0510_038": "(This is a vivid self-image sustained by his desire.\r\nIt must be the effects of Incarnation on matter.)",
    "svo0510_039": "I can kill in this world. And I can taste it.\r\nSo, I exist as an endless craving.",
    "svo0510_040": "That girl you mentioned, Fuuka, was it?\r\nOh, her soul was positively delectable.",
    "svo0510_041": "...!",
    "svo0510_042": "Her heart was filled with a delicate, bountiful love and concern for others.\r\nIt was sweeter than the richest honey.",
    "svo0510_043": "My only regret is not getting to savor it to the very last drop.",
    "svo0510_044": "You vile—!",
    "svo0510_045": "Stay calm, Neige. He's trying to provoke you.",
    "svo0510_046": "...!",
    "svo0510_047": "Hm. Don't you want to fight? Here I was thinking I'd eat your soul first\r\nif you did. I suppose you get to live a little—",
    "svo0510_048": "Huh?",
    "svo0510_049": "Didn't go through, did it?",
    "svo0510_050": "You're all bark and no bite, Death Gun. I mean, come on.\r\nYou didn't even scratch him.",
    "svo0510_051": "That's a monster.\r\nYour sword would've done as little.",
    "svo0510_052": "Heh heh. Look at you shaking. Scared?",
    "svo0510_053": "...",
    "svo0510_054": "Don't worry, Eiji! I know you can fight!",
    "svo0510_055": "Yuna...",
    "svo0510_056": "That's right. You're not the same person you were before.\r\nBesides, we're here.",
    "svo0510_057": "Kirito. Everyone's in place! Just say the word!",
    "svo0510_058": "We're all here like you wanted, Gabriel.\r\nWe'll show you just how we measure up.",
    "svo0510_059": "By all means.",
    "svo0510_059_2": "Now, time to dine!",
    "svo0510_060": "GRAAAHHH!",
    "svo0510_061": "...",
    "svo0510_062": "He's taking almost no damage. His power is immense.",
    "svo0510_063": "Yeah. He's more than just strong. There's nothing behind his attacks.\r\nHe's an utter void.",
    "svo0510_064": "This isn't enough.",
    "svo0510_065": "What?",
    "svo0510_066": "How can I better season this flavor?\r\nHm, looks like you need a bigger swell of emotion.",
    "svo0510_067": "In which case—",
    "svo0510_068": "Huh?",
    "svo0510_069": "No!",
    "svo0510_070": "System Call.",
    "svo0510_071": "Insulate Target Unit.",
    "svo0510_072": "Hm?",
    "svo0510_073": "...",
    "svo0510_074": "Huh? Did he just disappear? What was that?",
    "svo0510_075": "Was that magic? It didn't quite look like it.",
    "svo0510_076": "Quinella.",
    "svo0510_077": "As if we had a choice.\r\nWhen were we going to use it if not now?",
    "svo0510_078": "You saved our hides.\r\nBut what exactly was that? What did you do?",
    "svo0510_079": "I banished him to a Liminal Space.\r\nA certain little mouse and I set it up.",
    "svo0510_080": "That was the plan for dealing with Gabriel I mentioned earlier.",
    "svo0510_081": "I constructed the spellwords based on Heathcliff's knowledge of the world's\r\nframework, so Quinella could use them in battle.",
    "svo0510_082": "At least, that was the plan.",
    "svo0510_083": "I used the fight with Fuuka for reference.\r\nRegardless of strength, teleportation arts seemed to be effective.",
    "svo0510_084": "Still, it was an incomplete spell at best.",
    "svo0510_085": "So it didn't work?",
    "svo0510_086": "It did eject him to a different address.\r\nHowever, even if all stars align, this isn't a permanent solution.",
    "svo0510_087": "It can't completely sever the connection to this space.\r\nOnce Gabriel becomes wise to that fact, he can return at will.",
    "svo0510_088": "Unfortunate that detail couldn't be better dealt with.",
    "svo0510_089": "Recreating the spell will take some time, and he's already seen it once,\r\nso I don't know if we can count on it again.",
    "svo0510_090": "I'm sorry.\r\nIt's my fault you were forced to use such a valuable trump card.",
    "svo0510_091": "I didn't use it just for you.\r\nWith fear and despair spreading Gabriel's strength was growing exponentially.",
    "svo0510_092": "Hmm. I have to agree with Quinella's judgment on this.",
    "svo0510_093": "With morale crumbling, our defeat was at hand. The action taken was necessary.\r\nYou need not fret, Neige.",
    "svo0510_094": "That said, I've already played my hand.\r\nSo, what should our next move be?",
    "svo0510_095": "Kirito, you mentioned you had an idea.",
    "svo0510_096": "Yeah, sort of. It's a gamble, though.",
    "svo0510_097": "Let's hurry up and get everyone together. I'll go over it.",
    "svo0510_098": "...And with that, we should have everyone up to speed on the situation.",
    "svo0510_099": "U-Um, so basically, we were able to seal this Gabriel guy away\r\nbut not completely.",
    "svo0510_100": "He'll get himself out at some point, right?",
    "svo0510_101": "But it won us some time to prepare, and we know exactly where the enemy is.\r\nThis is our chance to seize the initiative.",
    "svo0510_102": "We can decide when to fight and challenge him ourselves!",
    "svo0510_103": "Right. Not a bad position to be in.\r\nWay better than spending all our time nervously anticipating his assault.",
    "svo0510_104": "But that still leaves the question of how exactly we're going to beat him.",
    "svo0510_105": "Kiridude, you got a gameplan or somethin'?",
    "svo0510_106": "...",
    "svo0510_107": "I do.",
    "svo0510_108": "For real?! Well, don't keep us waiting. What are we doing?",
    "svo0510_109": "That I can't say.",
    "svo0510_110": "Huh?!",
    "svo0510_111": "Now hold on a sec, Kii-boy.",
    "svo0510_112": "To be perfectly honest, if I explained what this strategy entails,\r\nI don't think you'd care for it.",
    "svo0510_113": "But I can guarantee it'll work.\r\nI know I'm asking a lot, but I need you all to trust me on this.",
    "svo0510_114": "Of course!",
    "svo0510_115": "All right. I trust you.",
    "svo0510_116": "I suppose needs must.\r\nIf you insist, I guess I'll have to go along with it.",
    "svo0510_117": "Kirito's never let us down in times like these.",
    "svo0510_118": "I'm with Eugeo.",
    "svo0510_119": "You're the leader, so if those are your orders, I'll follow them.",
    "svo0510_120": "It'll be more interesting that way, anyway.",
    "svo0510_121": "N-No, no! Hold it right there! You jest, right?!\r\nHave you all gone completely out of your minds?",
    "svo0510_122": "You all saw how strong this Gabriel is, didn't you?!\r\nTaking him on is a suicide mission!",
    "svo0510_123": "Why is this the course of action you all prefer?!",
    "svo0510_124": "I, for one, am very interested in knowing what Kirito's observed and what plan\r\nhe has begun to incubate.",
    "svo0510_125": "Are you ready for the consequences?! Don't tell me you've forgotten how\r\nexceedingly realistic death is in this world, Kayaba.",
    "svo0510_126": "Is that supposed to dissuade me somehow?",
    "svo0510_127": "If we're risking death anyway, it's simply a matter of dying having learned\r\nsomething or dying in ignorance.",
    "svo0510_128": "Or are you saying that's not the case?",
    "svo0510_129": "Gah.",
    "svo0510_130": "There's a sight I'd like to see. What will Kirito's face look like when\r\nhe drags his friends to Hell? Heh heh heh.",
    "svo0510_131": "...",
    "svo0510_132": "(Does he really have a plan?)",
    "svo0510_133": "(The difference in stats is extraordinary.\r\nAnd we can't even use admin privileges with the system in lockdown.)",
    "svo0510_134": "What'll you do, Neige? It'd help a lot if you gave us a hand relaying info\r\nduring the battle. As much as you can, I mean.",
    "svo0510_135": "...\r\nI'll go.",
    "svo0510_136": "(After all, I can't just hang back and hide while everyone is exposed to\r\ndanger.)",
    "svo0511_001": "So you've come.",
    "svo0511_002": "You seem pretty chill being trapped.\r\nWere you expecting us?",
    "svo0511_003": "It seemed a certainty you'd be here eventually.\r\nThis was your only choice if you hoped to win.",
    "svo0511_004": "You're surrounded with nowhere to run.\r\nAre you sure you should be so relaxed?",
    "svo0511_005": "What a strange thing to ask. Does the lone lion quiver when he sees a herd of\r\ngazelle?",
    "svo0511_006": "You know, you struck me as a rational guy,\r\nso I was baffled that you didn't try to overwhelm us immediately.",
    "svo0511_007": "But I think I'm starting to get you, bit by bit.",
    "svo0511_008": "Are you now?",
    "svo0511_009": "Seeing as you want to savor our souls,\r\nthe most inconvenient thing for you would be for us to run off in every direction.",
    "svo0511_010": "So, instead, you let us have just the right amount of hope.",
    "svo0511_011": "You want us to think you're blinded by hubris,\r\nso we think we might actually stand a chance.",
    "svo0511_012": "Ha ha! Hahaha! How very perceptive.",
    "svo0511_013": "I want to take my time enjoying every moment,\r\nso it works better for me if the challenge comes from you.",
    "svo0511_014": "Of course, even if you became aware of my plan,\r\nthere's nothing you can do about it.",
    "svo0511_015": "To defeat me, you must be in perfect formation and challenge me.\r\nIt was an opportunity you couldn't possibly pass up.",
    "svo0511_016": "Yeah, you're right.\r\nWe had no choice but to play into your hands.",
    "svo0511_017": "We want to figure out what's messing up the world and fix it,\r\nso things get back to normal.",
    "svo0511_018": "You turned this world into one where death is rampant.\r\nTo fix that with you in the way, we have to defeat you.",
    "svo0511_019": "Yes, we both have a reason to fight.\r\nOur paths have aligned.",
    "svo0511_020": "You need a taste of hope to experience the true depths of despair.\r\nYou'll learn that soon enough.",
    "svo0511_021": "Time for the real fight to begin. Now come. Try not to bore me!",
    "svo0511_021_2": "Haha... Hahaha!",
    "svo0511_022": "I-Is he transforming?",
    "svo0511_023": "An angel—No, more like a demon.",
    "svo0511_024": "What is he?!",
    "svo0511_025": "Get ready to fight! This is his true form!",
    "svo0511_026": "So, if we take that down we win, right?\r\nLet's do it, guys!",
    "svo0511_027": "Ngh! I've never seen an Incarnation quite like this.\r\nCommander, you fought this—",
    "svo0511_028": "You'll find nothing within me. No heart. No emotion.",
    "svo0511_029": "Only your souls shriveling in fear at the edge of death will sate me.",
    "svo0511_030": "That man isn't driven by love or duty, or even anger or hatred.",
    "svo0511_031": "He's nothing but a void.\r\nSo, how is he still so fierce? So menacing?",
    "svo0511_032": "Be of stout heart, Eugeo. If you let yourself be swallowed up, it's over.",
    "svo0511_033": "Ah! I know!",
    "svo0511_034": "I dunno how long we can keep this up, ya know?",
    "svo0511_035": "Yeah, together we're somehow holding him back,\r\nbut if he takes one of us out, we'll all go like dominoes.",
    "svo0511_036": "(I knew it. \r\nThis is all happening because I forced Quinella to use her trick before it was completely ready.)",
    "svo0511_037": "(If I hadn't been so bent on those supposed clues in the first place—)",
    "svo0511_038": "(Maybe we would've had more of a chance to think up strategies\r\nand everyone could escape.)",
    "svo0511_039": "(It's all my fault.)",
    "svo0511_040": "If only Fuuka was here instead of useless, scared little me—",
    "svo0511_041": "Guh! Agh!",
    "svo0511_042": "Kirito! Are you okay?!",
    "svo0511_043": "Y-Yeah, I think so.",
    "svo0511_044": "Ugh! I knew he was strong, but this is basically cheating!",
    "svo0511_045": "Kirito?",
    "svo0511_046": "Yeah?",
    "svo0511_047": "Are you sure you've got a trick up your sleeve?",
    "svo0511_048": "I do. It just needs a little longer.",
    "svo0511_049": "(I should've known. He's got nothing.)",
    "svo0511_050": "(He's only acting tough because he knows he has to keep our morale high.)",
    "svo0511_051": "(In this world, the more we let fear take over, the stronger Gabriel becomes.)",
    "svo0511_052": "Wouldn't it be better to retreat for now?\r\nIf we split up, we might be able to avoid getting totally wiped out.",
    "svo0511_053": "But if we do that, some of us will certainly be sacrificed.\r\nAnd that's exactly what he wants.",
    "svo0511_054": "And then when the fighting starts again it would be an even tougher battle\r\nwith a smaller force on our side.",
    "svo0511_055": "Then you really intend to win here and now?\r\nYou're serious about this?",
    "svo0511_056": "Neige, are you scared?",
    "svo0511_057": "I-I am, yeah.",
    "svo0511_058": "I'm sorry. Everyone's fighting for me,\r\nand I know being scared makes him stronger, but I can't help it!",
    "svo0511_059": "Good.",
    "svo0511_060": "What?",
    "svo0511_061": "You've acknowledged your weakness and fear.\r\nThat's the first step to finding your courage.",
    "svo0511_062": "Don't worry. We won't go down so easily.\r\nWhatever happens, we'll keep you safe.",
    "svo0511_063": "Keep you...",

    "svo0511_069_2": "Honestly. What a handful!",

    "svo0511_073": "When someone gets hurt or suffers because of my weakness,\r\nam I not supposed to care so long as it isn't me who gets hurt?",
    "svo0511_074": "No, it shouldn't be that way.",
    "svo0511_075": "You're so right...",

    "svo0511_080_2": "Fuuka?",
    "svo0511_081": "Everyone, listen well!",
    "svo0511_082": "That man—Gabriel—can be defeated!",
    "svo0601_001": "Okay, we somehow managed to escape the Test Room.",
    "svo0601_002": "Gabriel isn't coming after us for now, I think.\r\nBut he wouldn't have simply given up, right? Not with how fixated he's been on you.",
    "svo0601_003": "He must be trying to draw things out, to feed our fears and toy with us.\r\nIf so, he could literally show up at any moment.",
    "svo0601_004": "Oh. *sniffle*",
    "svo0601_005": "Fuuka, you can't do this right now! Get up!\r\nWe have to get as far away from him as we—",
    "svo0601_006": "I can't. I-It hurts.",
    "svo0601_007": "Calm down! This is VR. We're in ALO! The pain isn't real.\r\nIt's just an illusion—",
    "svo0601_008": "Don't lie to me! There's no way this is an illusion!",
    "svo0601_009": "Fuuka.",
    "svo0601_010": "If it's an illusion, why does it hurt so much?! Why am I so scared?!\r\nWh-Why do I know I'm gonna die?",
    "svo0601_011": "I see. As I thought, this is his power. The power of his imagination.",
    "svo0601_012": "If only I'd done something sooner...\r\nNo! I can regret things later!",
    "svo0601_013": "Hey, Fuuka, can you move a little more?\r\nI can heal your wounds if we make it to the System Console.",
    "svo0601_014": "There might be something we can do about Gabriel if we have your eyes.",
    "svo0601_015": "No, I don't want to.\r\nI-If he catches up to us, he'll kill me.",

    "svo0601_032": "I didn't have time to pin down the alignment,\r\nso I ended up having to cut out a sizable chunk of ALO.",
    "svo0601_033": "Which means I dragged us and a bunch of other players along for the ride.\r\nBut hey, it's better than dying.",
    "svo0601_034": "The problem is that so long as he's still alive and well,\r\nwe can't get this intermingling space back to normal.",

    "svo0601_042": "Oh man, I'm in it now. I've got no idea what just happened,\r\nbut the world's messed all the way up.",
    "svo0601_043": "Hmm, what should I do now? Welp, it'd be nice if I could, at least,\r\nmake it back to the Test Room.",
    "svo0601_044": "You all right there, Neige? You were frozen for a second.\r\nWere you restarting or something?",
    "svo0601_045": "N-Neige?",
    "svo0601_046": "What? Are you confused? That's your name, isn't it?",
    "svo0601_047": "You're Neige, Galaxia's development Support AI.",

    "svo0601_049": "Sure you're okay? Do you remember?",
    "svo0601_050": "They say the sensation of death seriously affects the body.\r\nShe probably had misgivings about that.",
    "svo0601_051": "I'm affected by overfitting, which means I'm particularly susceptible to\r\nstimuli from virtual worlds.",
    "svo0601_052": "If Gabriel had killed me, no doubt it would've been the worst-case scenario:\r\ndying in The Real World.",
    "svo0601_053": "And he was specifically targeting me.",
    "svo0601_054": "Even if I hadn't been hurt, I eventually would've been caught.\r\nOr my mind would've broken, overtaken by fear.",
    "svo0601_055": "This is a VR world. Maybe things would've worked out if\r\nI could've convinced myself my injuries here aren't real.",
    "svo0601_056": "But I'm such a wimp. I never could've done that.",
    "svo0601_057": "That's why she used the Galaxia system to overwrite my memories,\r\nso that I would forget Gabriel's visualization of death.",
    "svo0601_058": "At the same time, she swapped our bodies,\r\nwhich Support AI can do at any time to act as substitutes.",
    "svo0601_059": "And sacrificed herself.",
    "svo0601_060": "She saved me. She offered herself up to protect me.",
    "svo0601_061": "I don't know why a Support AI would even do that,\r\nand it's not like I could ask her now.",
    "svo0601_062": "But I—\r\nI want to live a life that honors her sacrifice!",
    "svo0601_063": "It took me a little while to understand. But I'm doing this.\r\nWatch over me, Neige.",
    "svo0601_064": "No way! Fuuka was killed by Gabriel.",
    "svo0601_065": "Looks like I was right. They switched places.",
    "svo0601_066": "They what? You mean—",
    "svo0601_067": "Wait, let me get this straight.",
    "svo0601_068": "Neige was actually Fuuka.\r\nAnd who we thought was Fuuka was Neige all along?",
    "svo0601_069": "So, that's how that AI protected you.\r\nNow it seems so clear.",
    "svo0601_070": "Either way, she was a wonderful morsel.",
    "svo0601_071": "Don't you talk about her like that.",
    "svo0601_072": "Enough about the past, then. Let's talk about the future.\r\nWhat do you even hope to achieve at this point?",
    "svo0601_073": "That AI gave her life to let you escape, yet here you are, right in front of\r\nme. You have squandered her sacrifice.",
    "svo0601_074": "It won't be wasted. You can't kill me.",
    "svo0601_075": "Kirito and the others will protect me.\r\nAnd you can't beat them.",
    "svo0601_076": "After all, you're nothing but a frightened liar.",
    "svo0601_077": "...",
    "svo0601_078": "Have you forgotten?\r\nI was the one who found you weakly struggling and begging for help.",
    "svo0601_079": "You mean, I took advantage of your simpleminded sympathy.",
    "svo0601_080": "Regardless of whether you asked for help, you were broken.\r\nOr was that also an act? Why were you in that sorry state to begin with?",
    "svo0601_081": "Being defeated so terribly left you carved with horror\r\nand trauma, did it not?",
    "svo0601_082": "I do not know fear.",
    "svo0601_083": "And what event does the word defeat describe?\r\nIs it your HP going to 0?",
    "svo0601_084": "Is it the destruction of your configuration data?\r\nHaving your account deleted?",
    "svo0601_085": "Do you believe any one of those things would, as you say, carve horror into me?\r\nDo you really?",
    "svo0601_086": "No. It's not that I believe it. I know it.",
    "svo0601_087": "My eyes let me see them.\r\nAll of those wounds.",
    "svo0601_088": "Wounds?",
    "svo0601_089": "You asked about defeat earlier. Let me answer that question for you.",
    "svo0601_090": "Defeat is the awareness that you lost.",
    "svo0601_091": "You remember your defeat and your past fear.\r\nTo my eyes they look like wounds—Like errors. I see them clear as day.",
    "svo0601_092": "...",
    "svo0601_093": "You're no invincible god of death.",
    "svo0601_094": "You're just a miserable man who can't control his cravings\r\ndespite his great fear of losing.",
    "svo0601_095": "...",
    "svo0601_096": "You know, I tried to humor your absurd little speech.\r\nBut that was a poor taunt and an even worse bluff.",
    "svo0601_097": "...",
    "svo0601_098": "However the world may appear to you, you're the only one who perceives it that way.\r\nYou can't share that experience with anyone.",
    "svo0601_099": "Are your presumptuous remarks about things you're not even sure of\r\nsupposed to make me quake in my boots?",
    "svo0601_100": "Or has this entire conversation been a meaningless ruse to facilitate\r\na surprise attack?",
    "svo0601_101": "Nope.",
    "svo0601_102": "Wrong on all counts.\r\nYou have no idea what it is she just did.",
    "svo0601_103": "Heh, heh, heh.",
    "svo0601_104": "I see. So, that's it? This time, he took damage.",
    "svo0601_105": "Gabriel. I just shot you. Right in the arm. And you know what?\r\nIt's injured.",
    "svo0601_106": "...",
    "svo0601_107": "It's not a big deal whether what I said was right or not.",
    "svo0601_108": "Neige tried to save me by taking away my memories and switching places with me.",
    "svo0601_109": "She did it because I was weak.",
    "svo0601_110": "Because when you hurt me, I was in such anguish I could've died,\r\nso gripped by fear I could've lost my mind.",
    "svo0601_111": "But that weak, scared girl got her memories back.\r\nAnd she's resisting the visualization of death you spread.",
    "svo0601_112": "What I said before might've been a bluff.\r\nMaybe I can't really see your wounds.",
    "svo0601_113": "Even so, I psyched you out, didn't I?",
    "svo0601_114": "What I'm saying is, even a helpless and scared little girl like me\r\nwas able to surpass your terror!",
    "svo0601_115": "You should cut yourself a little more slack.",
    "svo0601_116": "I do confess, I know exactly what you're trying to say.",
    "svo0601_117": "Have you figured it out yet, Gabriel?\r\nIn this world, it's all too easy to be affected by others' perceptions.",
    "svo0601_118": "You gained a lot of power by killing and being feared.\r\nBut to turn that around—",
    "svo0601_119": "If we see you for the worm you are, your frailty grows.",
    "svo0601_119_2": "Oh, yes!",
    "svo0601_120": "Ngh!",
    "svo0601_121": "Listen up, everyone. This is the part where we put our collective foot down!\r\nLet's end this!",
    "svo0601_122": "But—",
    "svo0601_123": "Uh-huh.",
    "svo0601_124": "We did it.",
    "svo0601_125": "Phew. I think I broke a sweat.\r\nIt's over, right? It must be.",
    "svo0601_126": "I guess that's as far as you go, Gabriel.",

    "svo0601_128": "Gabriel.",
    "svo0601_129": "How do you see yourself now?\r\nDo you still believe you're an invincible god of death?",
    "svo0601_130": "Had enough? Can you handle any more?",
    "svo0601_131": "...",
    "svo0601_132": "I suppose I am partially responsible for all of this.",

    "svo0601_145": "Don't let your guard down! This isn't over yet!",
    "svo0601_146": "Right. It seems you didn't appreciate the form I had until now.\r\nThen, how about this one?",

    "svo0601_147_2": "An Incarnation of the Radius!",
    "svo0601_148": "The guardian of the Ruby Palace on the 100th Floor of Aincrad.\r\nThat was meant to be the last boss of SAO.",
    "svo0601_149": "I found this monster at the place where that AI drove me with that\r\nteleportation spell.",
    "svo0601_150": "She probably meant to take me down with her.\r\nUnfortunately for her, it seems to have backfired.",
    "svo0601_151": "Did you command it by drawing it into yourself?",
    "svo0601_152": "Perceptive as always. I've become one with this monstrosity.\r\nIts power is mine!",
    "svo0601_153": "Now! Tremble and scatter before me screaming!",
    "svo0601_154": "I will devour your souls! Sup on them to the very last drop!\r\nI will take everything from you!",
    "svo0601_155": "Even in this world, I continue to be \"one who robs!\"",
    "svo0601_155_2": "Haha... Hahahahaha!",
    "svo0601_156": "...",
    "svo0601_157": "Haha!",
    "svo0601_158": "The last boss of SAO, huh?",
    "svo0601_159": "What's this? Has the horror broken your mind?",
    "svo0601_160": "Oh, it's definitely scary-looking.\r\nAnd I know, for a fact, it's an extremely challenging boss.",
    "svo0601_161": "But despite that—",
    "svo0601_162": "Actually, no. It's not despite that, it's precisely because of that,\r\nthat we won't lose.",
    "svo0601_163": "Yet another bluff?",
    "svo0601_164": "Don't be ridiculous. You already know there's no way for us to win\r\nif we don't hold the right cards.",
    "svo0601_165": "And that...",
    "svo0601_165_2": "That's why you're going to lose.",
    "svo0601_166": "You're gonna lose to us and to the bond between Fuuka and Neige.",
    "svo0601_167": "And to the power of people's hopes, just like in our fight in Underworld.",
    "svo0601_168": "Do you hear me, Gabriel Miller?",
    "svo0601_169": "What a pathetic provocation.",
    "svo0601_170": "There is no dread inside me. No anger or turmoil.\r\nOnly an endless hunger and a fathomless thirst.",
    "svo0601_171": "You are sustenance. Here to provide me with a moment's satisfaction.\r\nThat is all you are.",
    "svo0601_172": "That's not what any of us are!\r\nAnd I'm going to prove it to you.",
    "svo0601_173": "Everyone, will you believe in me enough to stand with me and go a little\r\nfurther?",
    "svo0601_174": "As if ya had to ask, Kiridude!",
    "svo0601_175": "Why the formality? Just say, \"I'm counting on you.\"\r\nThat's all I need to hear, partner.",
    "svo0601_176": "Kazuto, if anything, you should be relying on us more.",
    "svo0601_177": "It is a foolish question to begin with.\r\nI will show him up close the edge of my blade.",
    "svo0601_178": "Oh, if you insist! Let's give him what for!",
    "svo0601_179": "I owe you for so much.\r\nThis is the least I can do.",
    "svo0601_180": "Pina and I are with you all the way!",
    "svo0601_181": "Cuh caw!",
    "svo0601_182": "We're not just here to help you. We're doing this for each other!",
    "svo0601_183": "Hoo, boy. Never a dull day with you, is there, Kirito?",
    "svo0601_184": "I might be able ta make a few bucks sellin' a story about this.",
    "svo0601_185": "You did give me a fresh, new experience.\r\nI'll reward you with my grace until this is over.",
    "svo0601_186": "Eh, we're all in this boat together.\r\nBesides, it'll make a good story later.",
    "svo0601_187": "It definitely hasn't been easy.\r\nI guess I want to bring this to a clear, satisfying end.",
    "svo0601_188": "SAO's last boss? Heh heh, seems fun.",
    "svo0601_189": "Hmm, it seems I'm taking orders this time.\r\nOur roles from back in Aincrad have reversed, it seems.",
    "svo0601_190": "I'm not doing this for you, Kirito.\r\nBut I will do what's right.",
    "svo0601_191": "Let's give it our best shot!",
    "svo0601_192": "Confound it! Why have I been roped into this? Argh!\r\nPlease, let this all workout somehow!",
    "svo0601_193": "I'll be watching over you.\r\nMaster's waiting outside and says you better get back in one piece.",
    "svo0601_194": "Kirito, I'm sure by now you know how I'd answer that question\r\nbefore you even asked it.",
    "svo0601_195": "Where Daddy and Mommy go, I go!",
    "svo0601_196": "Thank you. Thank you, everyone.",
    "svo0601_197": "I'm asking you, please! Please, put an end to this!",
    "svo0601_198": "Leave it to us!",
    "svo0601_199": "Are you all ready to drown in despair?\r\nI'll eat your souls!",
    "svo0601_200": "My answer to that is the same as it was in Underworld, Gabriel.\r\nAnd I'll say it as many times as I need to.",
    "svo0601_201": "Why, you...",
    "svo0601_201_2": "Just you try!",
    "svo0601_202": "It's over, Gabriel!",
    "svo0601_203": "Ngh. Gah!",
    "svo0601_204": "How?",
    "svo0601_205": "How did you succeed when my stats so greatly exceed your own?\r\nIs your self-image really so mighty?",
    "svo0601_206": "We didn't awaken some sort of special, ultra-powerful Incarnation, you know.",
    "svo0601_207": "You don't care much for games, do you, Gabriel?",
    "svo0601_208": "Wh-What?",
    "svo0601_209": "You don't hesitate to take a life.\r\nYou're one terrifying person.",
    "svo0601_210": "If we fought in real life, there's no way I'd win.\r\nI wouldn't even know what to do.",
    "svo0601_211": "Then, how?",
    "svo0601_212": "It's actually pretty simple.",
    "svo0601_213": "When you're in that form, I can very clearly envision myself\r\ntaking you down without much trouble.",
    "svo0601_214": "Melding with that monster was effectively\r\nthe biggest mistake you could've made.",
    "svo0601_215": "However great the stat difference might be, every player knows\r\nthe purpose of a last boss is to be defeated.",
    "svo0601_216": "You lost because you didn't understand that.",
    "svo0601_217": "...",
    "svo0601_218": "You said you found that thing and took it into yourself\r\nat the place where Neige sent you, right?",
    "svo0601_219": "Then you ruined your own chances. You practically walked into her trap—\r\nThat girl who you saw as nothing but food.",
    "svo0601_220": "...Hah.",
    "svo0601_221": "Hah haha. How ironic. The one who robs had victory stolen from him.",
    "svo0601_222": "But I still crave... I still have the urge to take souls with my own hands.",
    "svo0601_223": "One day, I will return again in a new form and—",
    "svo0601_224": "Oh, so that's what it is.",
    "svo0601_225": "What?",
    "svo0601_226": "The thing you're so scared of. I noticed something enveloping you ever since\r\nyou started accepting your demise.",
    "svo0601_227": "Stop.",
    "svo0601_228": "It's almost like it came to retrieve you.",
    "svo0601_229": "No! Don't you dare say another word!",
    "svo0601_230": "See? You were lying so hard about not being afraid.\r\nLike I said, you really are just a frightened liar.",
    "svo0601_231": "No! Stop! Stop this! Let me go! Let go—",
    "svo0601_232": "Alicia, please!\r\nALICIAAAAAAAAA!",
    "svo0601_233": "He vanished.",
    "svo0601_234": "Hmph. What a way to go. Pathetic.",
    "svo0601_235": "So, what was all that about, right at the end?\r\nWho's Alicia?",
    "svo0601_236": "It was like he saw something that horrified him.",
    "svo0601_237": "It was a cluster of data linked to him.\r\nAt least, that's all it looked like to me.",
    "svo0601_238": "It lacked the data density to be clearly visible.\r\nCould be one of his memories or some sort of record data.",
    "svo0601_239": "I couldn't say exactly what it was,\r\nbut it probably holds special significance to him.",
    "svo0601_240": "Ah, you've returned. And all accounted for. You did well.",
    "svo0601_241": "Thanks, Cardinal. It's over... Finally.",
    "svo0601_242": "Yeah. You said it.",
    "svo0601_243": "I mean, yeah, it's great, but uh, where the heck did Fuuka come from?",
    "svo0601_244": "That's what I wanna know! And where'd Neige go?",
    "svo0601_245": "Um, let me explain.",
    "svo0601_246": "So, that's what happened. You swapped places.",
    "svo0601_247": "Your name and look are throwing me off, but basically,\r\nyou're the Neige we've been traveling with this whole time?",
    "svo0601_248": "Y-Yeah, that's right.",
    "svo0601_249": "You'd known for a while, hadn't you, Kirito?\r\nWhen did you notice?",
    "svo0601_250": "When we looked at the first document file, something didn't feel right.",
    "svo0601_251": "How it talked about the way the world was didn't quite line up with the Fuuka\r\nI'd come to know.",
    "svo0601_252": "Eventually, I realized the possibility that they'd switched places made the\r\nmost sense.",
    "svo0601_253": "But I couldn't just come out and say it.\r\nFor one thing, I didn't have enough proof. But more importantly—",
    "svo0601_254": "If I hadn't arrived at the realization myself,\r\nI wouldn't have recovered my memories and found the courage to face Gabriel.",
    "svo0601_255": "One thing that helped guide me\r\nwas checking out the clues that were left behind.",
    "svo0601_256": "Another was the elimination of the threat.\r\nThat is, Gabriel being defeated and overcoming the terror he caused.",
    "svo0601_257": "I think when these two conditions were met,\r\nmy memories and appearance came back.",
    "svo0601_258": "Ah, so, the reason she disappeared when Gabriel defeated her was\r\nbecause she was an AI and not a physical being.",
    "svo0601_259": "Your guess was partially correct, Fuuka.\r\nThe \"spell\" was a way to bring \"Fuuka\" back.",
    "svo0601_260": "Except—",
    "svo0601_261": "Neige was \"Fuuka\" and I was \"Neige.\"\r\nAnd ultimately, there's no way of bringing her back.",
    "svo0601_262": "However, you regained your memories and stood up to Gabriel yourself.\r\nYou did her proud.",
    "svo0601_263": "You did us proud too, of course.",
    "svo0601_264": "That does bring me a small bit of solace.",
    "svo0601_265": "You've picked up where she left off.\r\nSo, in a way, she lives on in you.",
    "svo0601_266": "And you know what? She's probably really happy with that arrangement.",
    "svo0601_267": "Yeah. You're right.",
    "svo0601_268": "I caused you all so much trouble. But I can't thank you enough.\r\nI don't know what I would've done without your help.",
    "svo0601_269": "Are you implying we were summoned here to aid you?\r\nI suppose it was an entertaining experience in its own way.",
    "svo0601_270": "I must say, I agree. Though it irks me to be of the same mind as you.",
    "svo0601_271": "Lemme see if I can simplify Fuufuu's explanation.",
    "svo0601_272": "Basically, Neinei used her expanded permissions\r\nto reach beyond time and space and pull everyone to this world, yeah?",
    "svo0601_273": "Uh, is that actually possible?",
    "svo0601_274": "All I know is I'm not equipped with that kind of functionality.\r\nThere isn't any data on that kind of tech, either.",
    "svo0601_275": "And yet, Lady Cardinal and I,\r\nnot to mention all the others, are very much here. There's no denying that.",
    "svo0601_276": "Just what exactly was the AI we knew as Neige?",
    "svo0601_277": "There's no way of knowing now, is there? Such a shame.",
    "svo0601_278": "...",
    "svo0601_279": "Fuuka.",
    "svo0601_280": "Don't worry. I'm okay. Thanks, Yui.",
    "svo0601_281": "Come to think of it, Neige set me, \"Fuuka Natsuyagi\"\r\nas the key to unlocking the system.",
    "svo0601_282": "I don't know all the technical aspects, so it might be hard for me,\r\nbut do you think the system will go back to normal if I can unlock it?",
    "svo0601_283": "Probably, yeah. We've got a few experts here.",
    "svo0601_284": "This has been a rather enriching experience.\r\nI suppose I can return the favor by helping with this.",
    "svo0601_285": "When it's all done everyone will end up going back to where they came from,\r\nright?",
    "svo0601_286": "Hmph. It's over. This ridiculous mess is over.",
    "svo0601_287": "In any case, that's a conversation for a later time.\r\nI must first make a thorough inspection of Galaxia.",
    "svo0601_288": "I must admit I am curious about its programming,\r\nas it exceeds current standards. I'd like to analyze it.",
    "svo0601_289": "I think I would suffice. Although, a system that lets you easily tamper with memories and cognition is appealing. Heh heh heh.",
    "svo0601_290": "Putting aside whatever Sugou's aims may be,\r\nif we used Galaxia to lightly tweak memories and cognition...",
    "svo0601_291": "...We should be able to log out the players who were killed in this world,\r\nall the while minimizing any aftereffects.",
    "svo0601_292": "Please, do so.",
    "svo0601_293": "Speaking of which, what's gonna happen with this Galaxia functionality?\r\nIt spread a good bit.",
    "svo0601_294": "I think the issue will be how public the knowledge becomes.",
    "svo0601_295": "Whatever the case, research and development is probably still going on\r\nsomewhere we don't even know.",
    "svo0601_296": "Is that a good or a bad thing?",
    "svo0601_297": "The technology itself is neither good nor bad.\r\nMaybe someday it'll be useful for others.",
    "svo0601_298": "It is a pretty incredible feature.\r\nI'm sure people like Pito would be pretty happy.",
    "svo0601_299": "You know, the whole sense of realism or immersion when doing certain things?",
    "svo0601_300": "Oh, for sure.",
    "svo0601_301": "Well, whatever happens with Galaxia, I'm still responsible for what happened.",
    "svo0601_302": "This all started because I repaired Gabriel's data without a second thought.",
    "svo0601_303": "I've caused trouble for so many people.\r\nHow do I even begin to atone for this?",
    "svo0601_304": "Gabriel was in the wrong, Fuuka, not you. It's natural to reflect on mistakes,\r\nbut don't take the blame for another's evil.",
    "svo0601_305": "She's right.\r\nI don't think you did something deserving punishment.",
    "svo0601_306": "Still, I feel like it would make me feel better if I was punished.",
    "svo0601_307": "Nothing would change if you were.\r\nIt wouldn't bring Neige back, either.",
    "svo0601_308": "...",
    "svo0601_309": "But you already knew that.\r\nYou'll just have to carry some of that regret and guilt with you.",
    "svo0601_310": "I understand.\r\nAnd I don't say that lightly, either.",
    "svo0601_311": "You'll probably always wonder how things would've gone if you'd only done this\r\nor hadn't done that.",
    "svo0601_312": "Right. That's just how it is, isn't it?",
    "svo0601_313": "Yup. That's why, from now on, try to focus on what it is you CAN do.",
    "svo0601_314": "Is there anything really?",
    "svo0601_315": "Try to recall how this all started, like you mentioned earlier.",
    "svo0601_316": "A series of coincidences led you to find and restore Gabriel when he had all\r\nbut turned into junk data.",
    "svo0601_317": "Well, yeah, but what's that got to—\r\nOh!",
    "svo0601_318": "It's uncertain where in the virtual world the data you want is located.",
    "svo0601_319": "And it might take a long time to find considering the knowledge and skills you\r\nstill need.",
    "svo0601_320": "But, maybe, just maybe, you could do the same thing for a cheery,\r\nhopelessly helpful AI somewhere.",
    "svo5001_001": "Interesting. Having given it a second look, this is quite fascinating.",
    "svo5001_002": "Hmm.",
    "svo5001_003": "And I suppose this goes here and—",
    "svo5001_004": "I'm back.",
    "svo5001_005": "Well, hello. I wasn't expecting you so early.",
    "svo5001_006": "Yeah. Are you all alone?",
    "svo5001_007": "Um! Why are you wearing that?!",
    "svo5001_008": "That's quite the greeting.\r\nIs there something wrong with me wearing this attire?",
    "svo5001_009": "No, not really.\r\nI mean, why are you wearing it again?",
    "svo5001_010": "I figured you've seen me in this before,\r\nand you spoke with me comfortably then.",
    "svo5001_011": "Well, that's—\r\nGalaxia was messing with my memories that time!",
    "svo5001_012": "So, what, did it grow on you when you put it on back then?",
    "svo5001_013": "It did. I thought there was just something right about it.",
    "svo5001_014": "What do you mean? Because it's a uniform?",
    "svo5001_015": "Yes. And because there are so many varieties.",
    "svo5001_016": "There are school uniforms, police uniforms, the list goes on.",
    "svo5001_017": "I see. I take it there are many organizations which have adopted their use.",
    "svo5001_018": "I heard many people in The Real World feel power and intimidation from this\r\nuniform. Is this true?",
    "svo5001_019": "Yeah, you could say there's people like that out there.",
    "svo5001_020": "Heh heh. So, it is true. That is so interesting.",
    "svo5001_021": "In what way?",
    "svo5001_022": "Uniforms are outfits that indicate the wearer's affiliations and rank, correct?",
    "svo5001_023": "I can only imagine that those who see power in them wish to be led.\r\nUniforms must be quite convenient for rulers.",
    "svo5001_024": "It's almost as if that's exactly how you've used them.",
    "svo5001_025": "But there aren't any absolute rulers in our world. I mean, we have kings,\r\nbut I wouldn't put them in the same category as you.",
    "svo5001_026": "Is that so? This only gets more and more interesting.",
    "svo5001_027": "I have no idea what you're getting at.",
    "svo5001_028": "Well, let's look at it from the perspective of the one receiving the uniform\r\ninstead of the one bestowing it, shall we?",
    "svo5001_029": "Do you know what state of mind people enter when they don a uniform, boy?\r\n",
    "svo5001_030": "State of mind? I'd say a change of attitude or gaining a sense of responsibility.\r\nSomething like that?",
    "svo5001_031": "Heh heh, that's very like you. I find the way you think kind of endearing.",
    "svo5001_032": "But I'm trying to get at something more fundamental.\r\nI'm speaking of the conscious separation of one group from another. Exclusion.",
    "svo5001_033": "That might be an overstatement.\r\nThough, I do think it can cultivate fellowship.",
    "svo5001_034": "Are you so sure?\r\nWhat is fellowship, if not ultimately a mentality that excludes others?",
    "svo5001_035": "That is so wrong!\r\nWe don't exclude anyone simply because they're not our companions.",
    "svo5001_036": "You gather allies, coordinate your attire, and oppose other organizations\r\nto protect things such as order, fellowship, and honor.",
    "svo5001_037": "...",
    "svo5001_038": "It looks like it's starting to click for you.",
    "svo5001_039": "Introduce authority to that sense of exclusion, and you produce control.\r\nAnd with it, order, which is most convenient for an administrator.",
    "svo5001_040": "I don't think so. You only see the bad side.",
    "svo5001_041": "Uniforms have other uses, you know.",
    "svo5001_042": "I suppose they do have their uses.\r\nThey are useful for defining one's role and ensuring the swift execution of duties.",
    "svo5001_043": "Got back a little late, didn't we?",
    "svo5001_044": "I wonder if Daddy's home yet.",
    "svo5001_045": "It looks like someone's returned. Let's go out for a while, boy.\r\nJust the two of us.",
    "svo5001_046": "Just us? What for?",
    "svo5001_047": "You don't want to have this kind of conversation in front of them, do you?\r\nNot that I mind.",
    "svo5001_048": "Okay. I'll join you so long as we're not gone too long.",
    "svo5001_049": "Wonderful.\r\nThis is what you'd call a \"date\" isn't it?",
    "svo5001_050": "Absolutely not. This is in no way, shape, or form a date.",
    "svo5001_051": "Oh? What a shame.",
    "svo5001_052": "Now that I'm moving around in it, I must say, it's quite comfortable. It seems\r\nthe materials and textiles are more advanced than what we have in Underworld.",
    "svo5001_053": "Wearing this isn't dreary at all.\r\nI can see why some would become so attached to it.",
    "svo5001_054": "Then again, I can't see this being of much\r\nuse in carrying out duties or a Calling.",
    "svo5001_055": "Well, uh, that's probably 'cause you're wearing a school uniform.\r\nIt's a lot like the Swordcraft Academy uniform.",
    "svo5001_056": "Oh, really? That uniform was meant to foster obedience and loyalty more than\r\nit was meant to be functional.",
    "svo5001_057": "That's why I believe there was a similar intention behind this one.\r\nThough it's hard to tell from its design.",
    "svo5001_058": "I don't know much about that,\r\nbut I'd imagine it was designed with an emphasis on cuteness.",
    "svo5001_059": "Cuteness? Ah, I see. It's an outfit meant to embellish one's appearance.\r\nI can't say I'd thought of it in that way.",
    "svo5001_060": "Thank you, boy.\r\nYou've helped me deepen my understanding of The Real World.",
    "svo5001_061": "Sure thing.",
    "svo5001_062": "I think that's enough chit-chat for now. Let's head back now, eh?",
    "svo5001_063": "Yes, I concur. One last thing, though.\r\nDo you want to make a deal?",
    "svo5001_064": "No.",
    "svo5001_065": "That's not very agreeable of you.",
    "svo5001_066": "I know it'll be something shifty.",
    "svo5001_067": "How do you know that when you haven't even heard what I was going to propose\r\nyet?",
    "svo5001_068": "Your track record.",
    "svo5001_069": "Haven't I been helping you and your friends since I came to this world?",
    "svo5001_070": "...",
    "svo5001_071": "I had a realization seeing many of the players here:\r\nIf I went to The Real World, it would not be that difficult to rule over it.",
    "svo5001_072": "Not this again...",
    "svo5001_073": "So, if I can make it out of this world, you will take me to the real one.",
    "svo5001_074": "Huh?! There's no way I could do that!",
    "svo5001_075": "At the very least, I could make it a better world than the one you\r\ncurrently inhabit. One without war or hunger.",
    "svo5001_076": "You ruled Underworld—No, the Human Realm,\r\nand that sure as hell wasn't better.",
    "svo5001_077": "That's precisely why we should make a deal.",
    "svo5001_078": "Counsel me on making it a better world.\r\nI will obey you so long as there is integrity in your words.",
    "svo5001_079": "In doing so, your ideals would reflect upon the world.\r\nNot so bad an offer, is it?",
    "svo5001_080": "What are you even saying? I can't do something like that.",
    "svo5001_081": "Hmm...",
    "svo5001_082": "Regardless, it's impossible in my current state.\r\nThere's a high chance I would simply cease to exist if I left this world.",
    "svo5001_083": "As such, you are to start by helping me establish my existence.",
    "svo5001_084": "Do what now?",
    "svo5001_085": "That little girl who accompanies you is particularly interesting,",
    "svo5001_086": "Yui? She's not the same as—",
    "svo5001_087": "Of course, I know she and I are not the same.\r\nBut there should be a clue there, or as you say, a hint.",
    "svo5001_088": "That's the least you could do for me, right?",
    "svo5001_089": "Drop the downright loony talk of ruling anything,\r\nand I'll think about it.",
    "svo5001_090": "Yes, think about it as long as you like.\r\nI'll be expecting good news.",
    "svo5002_001": "...",
    "svo5002_002": "Well, Neige?",
    "svo5002_003": "As I thought, no connection. If I could just connect to the system,\r\nI'd be able to do at least a few more things.",
    "svo5002_004": "Well, there's not much we can do about that.\r\nIt's not your fault anyway, Neige.",
    "svo5002_005": "And it seems whatever trouble's going down, it won't be easy to fix.",
    "svo5002_006": "Then it looks like we'll just have to find the Test Room the hard way.\r\nSo shall we get started?",
    "svo5002_007": "Fuuka, we need to wait for Quinella and Leafa to return.\r\nThey're out doing recon.",
    "svo5002_008": "Oh, that's right.",
    "svo5002_009": "I'm not sure what they're actually doing.\r\nIt felt more like Quinella dragged Leafa along with her as a guidebook.",
    "svo5002_010": "Jeez, I can't tell if she's self-centered or just free-spirited.",
    "svo5002_011": "But they may be able to find us a city.\r\nWe could get a base of operations set up and all that.",
    "svo5002_012": "Yeah, Leafa can fly, so she can search across a pretty wide area, but, hmm.",
    "svo5002_013": "Neige, you wouldn't happen to know where the cities are located, would you?\r\nOr even take a guess from the terrain?",
    "svo5002_014": "I apologize.\r\nI'm afraid I'm not of much help in my current state.",
    "svo5002_015": "All right.\r\nThen it looks like we really will have to go about it the hard way.",
    "svo5002_016": "If only I could properly function in my capacity as a navigation AI.",
    "svo5002_017": "Like I said, that's not your fault.\r\nYou really don't have to worry about it.",
    "svo5002_018": "It might take some time, but we'll find one eventually if we look carefully.",
    "svo5002_019": "Thank you, Kirito.",
    "svo5002_020": "I wonder what'll happen to my job if this does take a while.\r\nEh, whatever.",
    "svo5002_021": "If it's a system error, like you say, then it's out of my hands.\r\nThey'd have no reason to get mad at me, right?",
    "svo5002_022": "In fact, I might even get a big, fat bonus if we manage to find the cause of\r\nthis bug!",
    "svo5002_023": "Oh, Fuuka, you do love your money.",
    "svo5002_024": "Hey, no, it could happen. This is a major bug.\r\nRestoring the system is taking a while, too.",
    "svo5002_025": "You'd be doing them a major service if you pinned down the cause.",
    "svo5002_026": "Right?! Okay, we should probably start looking, then.",
    "svo5002_027": "Quinella said she wanted to take a look around anyway.",
    "svo5002_028": "But there are enemies out there and belligerent players like the ones from\r\nbefore. Are we going to be all right?",
    "svo5002_029": "You'll be fine. I'll be your bodyguard.\r\nAnd we can rely on Leafa and Quinella.",
    "svo5002_030": "True. Those two are tough.\r\nThey'd saved us before we knew it.",
    "svo5002_031": "Yep. Leafa's as good with a sword as she is magic.\r\nShe's one of the top players in ALO. And Quinella is no slouch either.",
    "svo5002_032": "I'm not sure it's my place to ask, but what's your relationship to them?",
    "svo5002_033": "I'm guessing you were friends in another game.\r\nOr maybe IRL?",
    "svo5002_034": "Leafa's my little sister.\r\nWe play stuff like ALO together pretty often.",
    "svo5002_035": "Whoa, your actual sister?!\r\nSiblings gaming together?!",
    "svo5002_036": "Guess so.",
    "svo5002_037": "You two do get along quite well.\r\nIt makes sense you're related.",
    "svo5002_038": "Then what about Quinella? The way you spoke about her—\r\nIs it complicated?",
    "svo5002_039": "Is she—dare I ask—your girlfriend?",
    "svo5002_040": "H-Heck no! That's about as far from reality as you can get.",
    "svo5002_041": "Is that so? Very suspicious that you'd get so flustered.",
    "svo5002_042": "I'm telling you. We are definitely not dating. We just—\r\nA lot of stuff happened.",
    "svo5002_043": "Stuff, huh?",
    "svo5002_044": "Oh, is she your ex?",
    "svo5002_045": "No! Listen, she's really just someone I happen to know.",
    "svo5002_046": "But there's something about her.\r\nShe's got this majesty to her—",
    "svo5002_047": "Shh! Not a sound!",
    "svo5002_048": "What's wrong?",
    "svo5002_049": "Someone—\r\nScratch that, something is coming this way. Doubt it's Leafa and Quinella.",
    "svo5002_050": "I-Is it an enemy?",
    "svo5002_051": "Most likely. Stay back!",
    "svo5002_052": "Got it!",
    "svo5002_053": "Kirito, can you handle it on your own?!",
    "svo5002_054": "Yeah, I think I can.\r\nBut we're gonna run for it if things look bad, so be ready!",
    "svo5002_055": "Okay!",
    "svo5002_056": "Hyaaa!",
    "svo5002_057": "Phew, that was the last one.\r\nProbably. Neige, can you see if there are any more enemies?",
    "svo5002_058": "Right away!",
    "svo5002_059": "I believe the coast is clear.\r\nI couldn't sense anything that was still moving.",
    "svo5002_060": "Good to know. Should have a moment to relax, then.",
    "svo5002_061": "Well, let me just say you really are strong, Kirito!\r\nYou took out all those enemies while protecting us.",
    "svo5002_062": "Indeed. You seemed skilled before, but this confirms it.",
    "svo5002_063": "The enemies weren't that bad this time.\r\nAnd you made it easy for me to fight by staying somewhere easy to protect.",
    "svo5002_064": "But you even protected a Support AI like me.",
    "svo5002_065": "Why wouldn't I?\r\nI promised I'd protect both of you, didn't I?",
    "svo5002_066": "You did. Thank you.",
    "svo5002_067": "Hehe. Kirito, you're pretty cool.",
    "svo5002_068": "Y-Yeah?",
    "svo5002_069": "Yep. After all, you saved us when we were attacked,\r\nand you've been really good to Neige, who's a navigation AI.",
    "svo5002_070": "I don't think that makes me special or anything.",
    "svo5002_071": "Not so. There may be a lot of people who are kind,\r\nbut those who would protect us like this are few and far between.",
    "svo5002_072": "That's why I know I'm safe with you.",
    "svo5002_073": "In that case, count on me all you want. I'm sure we'll depend on you, too,\r\nwhen you manage to reconnect to the system!",
    "svo5002_074": "Yes! I'll do all in my power to help everyone when that time comes!",
    "svo5002_075": "You got all fired up, huh, Neige?",
    "svo5002_076": "Well, if we're going to make that a reality, we need to find the Test Room\r\nas soon as we can. Let's hurry—",
    "svo5002_077": "Hold on there! Leafa and Quinella haven't come back yet.",
    "svo5002_078": "You said so yourself not that long ago.",
    "svo5002_079": "Oh, you're right. Apologies. I got ahead of myself.",
    "svo5002_080": "Haha, I do that a lot too.\r\nI get this itch to spring into action the moment I'm struck with an idea.",
    "svo5002_081": "I'm so embarrassed.",
    "svo5002_082": "It has been a good while since they left, though.\r\nMaybe they ran into some trouble.",
    "svo5002_083": "We were attacked after all.",
    "svo5002_084": "It's pretty unlikely that they'd be taken down easily.\r\nBut I am a little worried. Should we go find them?",
    "svo5002_085": "Yes, I think we should.\r\nThey went in that direction.",
    "svo5002_086": "That's right. Okay, let's go. And stay alert.",
    "svo5002_087": "I want you to stay close behind me. Don't fall behind.",
    "svo5002_088": "Understood!",
    "svo5002_089": "...",
    "svo5002_090": "What's the matter, Fuuka? Aren't you coming?",
    "svo5002_091": "Huh?! Oh, sorry.",
    "svo5002_092": "Did you get hurt in that last scuffle? If so—",
    "svo5002_093": "No, no, I'm fine. I just spaced out for a second.",
    "svo5002_094": "Are you sure you're okay?",
    "svo5002_095": "Never better.\r\nNow, let's go fetch Leafa and Quinella!",
    "svo5002_096": "Well, if you say you're okay—\r\nHey, wait for me!",
    "svo5002_097": "Don't leave me behind! Fuuka!",
    "svo5003_001": "...",
    "svo5003_002": "Uh, uhm?",
    "svo5003_003": "...",
    "svo5003_004": "We're not alone.",
    "svo5003_005": "What?",
    "svo5003_006": "E-Enemies?",
    "svo5003_007": "Is that all?",
    "svo5003_008": "Chirp!",
    "svo5003_009": "There's more!",
    "svo5003_010": "Th-That was a close one.",
    "svo5003_011": "Hmph.",
    "svo5003_012": "W-Wait!",
    "svo5003_013": "...",
    "svo5003_014": "Tch.",

    "svo5003_016": "...",
    "svo5003_017": "Something you want to say?",
    "svo5003_018": "W-Well...",
    "svo5003_019": "Spit it out.",
    "svo5003_020": "...",
    "svo5003_021": "I-I think it might be safer if we communicated more.",
    "svo5003_022": "Safer?",
    "svo5003_023": "You were the only one who saw the enemies back there.",
    "svo5003_024": "It's not my fault you aren't using your eyes.",
    "svo5003_025": "B-But that last one...",
    "svo5003_026": "What about it?",
    "svo5003_027": "N-Never mind.",
    "svo5003_028": "I saw what you did. You don't have to tell me.",
    "svo5003_029": "O-Oh. But it's just that—",
    "svo5003_030": "What else?",
    "svo5003_031": "I really think we should work together.",
    "svo5003_032": "I might not be as strong as you, but I can hold my own, too!\r\nI survived SAO! Ah! Oops.",
    "svo5003_033": "What did you say?",
    "svo5003_034": "N-Nothing.",
    "svo5003_035": "Heh, heh, heh.",
    "svo5003_036": "You're an SAO survivor.",
    "svo5003_037": "You know that I was a member of Laughing Coffin.",
    "svo5003_038": "Yes.",
    "svo5003_039": "You must fear me.",
    "svo5003_040": "Yes, you are a little scary.",
    "svo5003_041": "But you're lost in this crazy world, too.\r\nDon't you need help?",
    "svo5003_042": "I never need help.",
    "svo5003_043": "But aren't we cooperating right now?\r\nYou could have just left me.",
    "svo5003_044": "I don't expect anything of you in battle.",
    "svo5003_045": "If necessary, you can be a decoy.\r\nThat's all I need you for. Heh, heh, heh.",
    "svo5003_046": "Fine, but we should at least communicate properl—",
    "svo5003_047": "That's enough.",
    "svo5003_048": "Don't test my patience.\r\nI could kill you in an instant.",
    "svo5003_049": "N-Not if I had anything to say about it.",
    "svo5003_050": "Oh?",
    "svo5003_051": "I wouldn't let you kill me.\r\nSure, you're a lot stronger than me, but still!",
    "svo5003_052": "I won't go down without a fight.",
    "svo5003_053": "Heh. Like you'd have a chance.\r\nDon't make me laugh.",
    "svo5003_054": "I... Pina and I were both saved in Aincrad.",
    "svo5003_055": "Me from Titan's Hand when they attacked me.\r\nPina actually did die once, until we brought her back on the Hill of Memories.",
    "svo5003_056": "So what? I can still kill you.",
    "svo5003_057": "No, you can't.",
    "svo5003_058": "I refuse to lose the life that was given to me to the likes of you!",
    "svo5003_059": "You can't be serious.",
    "svo5003_060": "I spent years making Laughing Coffin the epitome of fear and trembling.",
    "svo5003_061": "I was always a target.\r\nAnd none who came for me survived.",
    "svo5003_062": "But one cocky brat thinks she's up to it?",
    "svo5003_063": "Hmph.",
    "svo5003_064": "Stop.",
    "svo5003_065": "...",
    "svo5003_066": "I said stop.",
    "svo5003_067": "Eeek! Wh-What are you doing?!",
    "svo5003_068": "Let me go!",
    "svo5003_069": "Look. There's a trap.",
    "svo5003_070": "Huh? A trap?",
    "svo5003_071": "You're right.\r\nI would have gotten hurt if I kept going.",
    "svo5003_072": "Don't read into it. It's only an alarm.",
    "svo5003_073": "Look at the wall over there.",
    "svo5003_074": "Enemies?",
    "svo5003_075": "Trip the alarm, and they come running.",
    "svo5003_076": "Oh. Thank you.",
    "svo5003_077": "I said don't read into it. I was protecting myself.",
    "svo5003_078": "Okay, I get it. But...",
    "svo5003_079": "But what?",
    "svo5003_080": "Can you let go of my hand now?",
    "svo5003_081": "Mm.",
    "svo5003_082": "So what do we do about this trap?",
    "svo5003_083": "Go back? Or maybe we should deactivate it.",
    "svo5003_084": "No need.",
    "svo5003_085": "What do you mean \"no need\"?",
    "svo5003_086": "If we turn back, we can't scout ahead.\r\nThat isn't an option.",
    "svo5003_087": "If there are enemies in our sights...",
    "svo5003_088": "All we have to do is shoot first.",
    "svo5003_089": "Well, that would give us an edge in terms of damage.",
    "svo5003_090": "We split up to find an escape route.\r\nTurning back isn't an option.",
    "svo5003_091": "Unless you know how to deactivate the alarm.",
    "svo5003_092": "I'm sorry. I don't really know how.",
    "svo5003_093": "I figured. It was wishful thinking.",
    "svo5003_094": "If we can't get rid of the trap, a preemptive strike is our only option.",
    "svo5003_095": "O-Okay! You got that, Pina?",
    "svo5003_096": "Chirp!",
    "svo5003_097": "You take point.",
    "svo5003_098": "Y-You won't shoot me in the back or anything, will you?",
    "svo5003_099": "No.",
    "svo5003_100": "A-Are you sure?",
    "svo5003_101": "Just go.",
    "svo5003_102": "O-Okay! Sorry!",
    "svo5003_103": "Here I go! Three, two, one, go!",
    "svo5003_104": "I-Is that the last one?",
    "svo5003_105": "The area is clear, but don't get careless.",
    "svo5003_106": "R-Right!",
    "svo5003_107": "Um, Mister Death Gun?",
    "svo5003_108": "Mister?",
    "svo5003_109": "You made quick work of those enemies.\r\nYou're really strong.",
    "svo5003_110": "...",
    "svo5003_111": "And not only with a gun, but with a sword, too.",
    "svo5003_112": "...",
    "svo5003_113": "Can you actually see with that mask?\r\nYou did some really cool moves during that last fight.",

    "svo5003_116": "Girl.",
    "svo5003_117": "Yes?",
    "svo5003_118": "Why \"mister\"?",
    "svo5003_119": "Oh, you don't like it? How should I address you?",
    "svo5003_120": "Don't get so comfortable with me, girl.",
    "svo5003_121": "S-Sorry.",
    "svo5003_122": "Chiiirp!",
    "svo5003_123": "What's wrong, Pina?",

    "svo5003_142": "Yes.",

    "svo5003_146": "What?",

    "svo5003_148": "Spit it out.",
    "svo5003_149": "Could you please stop calling me \"you\" and \"girl\" and use my name?\r\nIt's Silica.",
    "svo5003_150": "Why?",

    "svo5003_153": "Do I have to?",
    "svo5003_154": "Yes. You do.",

    "svo5004_004": "Even though I've heard it a million times,\r\nit's like a totally different song live!",

    "svo5004_006": "Hee-hee! I like singing live better too,\r\nsince I can see everyone's smiles!",
    "svo5004_007": "She looked at me! Oh, I'm so embarrassed!",
    "svo5004_008": "Don't be. You have such a cute smile.",
    "svo5004_009": "I-I think I might faint.",

    "svo5004_011": "What about you? What did you think of my song?",
    "svo5004_012": "Waste of time.",
    "svo5004_013": "Hey! That's rude! Don't be a downer!\r\nThis is Yuna's show, not yours!",
    "svo5004_014": "Tch.",
    "svo5004_015": "I still can't believe that you set up this show for me.\r\nI must be dreaming.",

    "svo5004_022": "Yup.",
    "svo5004_023": "To close out the show... Oh!",
    "svo5004_024": "Hee hee!",
    "svo5004_025": "Can you play one more song? Encore! Encore!",
    "svo5004_026": "Well, since you asked!",
    "svo5004_027": "Tch...",
    "svo5004_028": "Thank you!",

    "svo5004_033": "Grrr...!",
    "svo5004_034": "Where do you think you are?",
    "svo5004_035": "What do you mean?",
    "svo5004_036": "At my show!",
    "svo5004_037": "No. This is a battlefield.",
    "svo5004_038": "Noise attracts the enemy and compromises your position.",
    "svo5004_039": "I've held my tongue, but enough's enough.",
    "svo5004_040": "Not a problem! I already made sure there were no enemies around\r\nbefore I started singing!",
    "svo5004_041": "You're right about attracting enemy attention.\r\nI wouldn't want to put my audience in danger.",
    "svo5004_042": "I can't understand why you'd try to stand out in a warzone.",
    "svo5004_043": "Songs have no place on the battlefield.",

    "svo5004_045": "Y-You're wrong!",
    "svo5004_046": "Yuna's songs give me strength!\r\nDon't say they don't have a place!",
    "svo5004_047": "When I hear her sing, I feel like I can do anything!",
    "svo5004_048": "Silica.",
    "svo5004_049": "Childish nonsense.",
    "svo5004_050": "Nuh-uh!",
    "svo5004_051": "Battle songs are a thing, aren't they?",
    "svo5004_052": "Songs are like magic spells that can move people's hearts,\r\nand Yuna's are the best!",
    "svo5004_053": "Is that how you feel about my music, Silica?",
    "svo5004_054": "That makes me very happy. Thank you.",
    "svo5004_055": "Ah! Sorry if I went a little overboard.",
    "svo5004_056": "Nonsense.\r\nReal power isn't affected by wasteful emotions.",
    "svo5004_057": "You do have a point.\r\nMy songs only have a small effect on each listener.",
    "svo5004_058": "But spread that effect through a whole audience,\r\nand that something small can be a big help, no?",
    "svo5004_059": "The words of a weakling thriving on the adoration of fools.",
    "svo5004_060": "I fight alone. I don't depend on others.",
    "svo5004_061": "Haha! Well, you are strong! That's for sure!",
    "svo5004_062": "In any case, your music doesn't suit me.",
    "svo5004_063": "I don't care for words of hope and courage.",
    "svo5004_064": "The melody is too bright. Too busy.",
    "svo5004_065": "Grrr!",
    "svo5004_066": "Oh, I see! So you don't like my music!",
    "svo5004_067": "That's right.",
    "svo5004_068": "Hmmm.",
    "svo5004_069": "Well let me ask you, do you pick a weapon based on a single glance?",
    "svo5004_070": "Of course not. That would be foolish.",
    "svo5004_071": "It's the same with music.\r\nYou have to listen carefully to take it all in.",
    "svo5004_072": "...",
    "svo5004_073": "And don't just decide so quick that Yuna's music is too bright or busy!",
    "svo5004_074": "It's not just that her music gives you energy!\r\nHer lyrics are heartfelt and moving!",
    "svo5004_075": "An illusion.",
    "svo5004_076": "You should read them before you pass judgment!\r\nI'll even send them to you!",
    "svo5004_077": "No time.",
    "svo5004_078": "...",
    "svo5004_079": "I think this song is beautiful.\r\nYuna's voice fits perfectly with that kind of dark tone.",
    "svo5004_080": "It's the kind of song you listen to\r\nover and over again when you feel a little spent.",
    "svo5004_081": "Hope in a light, er, a person in a light beside you...\r\nIt feels completely off.",
    "svo5004_082": "She's talking about the despair of failure!\r\nIt's not about right or wrong!",
    "svo5004_083": "It's naive.",
    "svo5004_084": "Urrrgh!",
    "svo5004_085": "Haha! You actually read my lyrics! I'm impressed.",
    "svo5004_086": "Did I have a choice?\r\nAnyway, they don't agree with me.",
    "svo5004_087": "That's fine. Everyone interprets music differently.",
    "svo5004_088": "What's important is that you feel something.",
    "svo5004_089": "And if you take anything away from my music at all,\r\nthat makes it all worth it.",
    "svo5004_090": "...",
    "svo5004_091": "Yuna, you really are incredible.",
    "svo5004_092": "I knew that it's okay for people to be different and have different tastes...",
    "svo5004_093": "But you put it so well!",
    "svo5004_094": "I really look up to you, Yuna!",
    "svo5004_095": "That's sweet of you to say, Silica!\r\nI'll keep on singing, so I hope I keep living up to your expectations!",
    "svo5004_096": "Oh, I know! If you like singing, why don't you join me sometime?",
    "svo5004_097": "M-Me? S-Sing with you? F-For real?!",
    "svo5004_098": "It's fun to listen to music, but singing is a whole different kind of fun!",
    "svo5004_099": "I, um, I—\r\nI can't.",
    "svo5004_100": "You don't like singing?",
    "svo5004_101": "No, that's not it! I love singing!",
    "svo5004_102": "But the idea of singing with you is too much.\r\nIt's way too nerve-wracking!",
    "svo5004_103": "What's there to be nervous about?",
    "svo5004_104": "Believe me! I'm happy for the offer, really!",
    "svo5004_105": "I'm just not ready yet. I want to train first.\r\nSomeday we can!",
    "svo5004_106": "Hee hee! Well, I'll remember that as a promise.",
    "svo5004_107": "Yeah!",
    "svo5004_108": "What about you? Feeling a duet?",
    "svo5004_109": "What are you talking about?",
    "svo5004_110": "Hm? Did I say something strange?",
    "svo5004_111": "You seem to have a storm of feelings locked inside you.",
    "svo5004_112": "I think they would make an incredible song.",
    "svo5004_113": "Mister Death Gun? Sing?",
    "svo5004_114": "That's a great idea!",
    "svo5004_115": "No. Such amusements are pointless.",
    "svo5004_116": "Oh. Well, everyone deals with their feelings in their own way, I suppose.",
    "svo5004_117": "Awww! I wanted to see you sing.",
    "svo5004_118": "Leave me out of this stupidity.",
    "svo5004_119": "Do you mind if I sing a little more?\r\nTalking with you two has gotten me all pumped up!",
    "svo5004_120": "You're gonna sing for us more?\r\nOf course, we don't mind!",
    "svo5004_121": "Great! I want my songs to last in others' hearts as long as they can!",
    "svo5004_122": "Is that all right with you, Death Gun?",
    "svo5004_123": "At least, make it bearable.\r\nThat last one was a mess.",
    "svo5004_124": "No, it wasn't!",
    "svo5004_125": "It's okay, Silica.\r\nAny requests then, Mr. Death Gun?",
    "svo5004_126": "Don't misunderstand me.\r\nI've no requests to begin with.",
    "svo5004_127": "Here comes my next song!",
    "svo5005_001": "This place is riddled with danger.\r\nI sense immense hostility here.",
    "svo5005_002": "However, there are far too few people here for the city's size.\r\nWhat sort of place is this?",
    "svo5005_003": "My thoughts exactly.\r\nI would venture to say this place's very purpose is for battle.",
    "svo5005_004": "Do you mean as a sort of training ground?",
    "svo5005_005": "You could say that.\r\nThose who come to this world are likely interested in growing stronger.",
    "svo5005_006": "I see. Then there will most likely be foes here to train against.",
    "svo5005_007": "Most definitely.\r\nA plethora of bloodthirsty monsters, I'm sure.",
    "svo5005_008": "There are a great many types of monsters in the world to contend with.",
    "svo5005_009": "What a well-thought-out training ground.\r\nWould you mind telling me more?",
    "svo5005_010": "So you may be attacked by the spirits of the dead or their remains.\r\nThough, there's a greater danger of this at night.",
    "svo5005_011": "Fascinating. You seem to be quite knowledgeable about this world.",
    "svo5005_012": "I'm glad to have met someone so experienced.",
    "svo5005_013": "But of course.\r\nI once ruled over a certain world myself.",
    "svo5005_014": "Ruled over, you say?",
    "svo5005_015": "Indeed. Though it was a bit different from this world.\r\nI was known as Oberon the Great Fairy King.",
    "svo5005_016": "You were a king? That is somewhat hard to believe.",
    "svo5005_017": "If I had the same power as I did then,\r\nI wouldn't be stuck in this world.",
    "svo5005_018": "But unfortunately, that power was taken from me.\r\nTaken from me by a fool who knew nothing of the workings of this world.",
    "svo5005_019": "I see.",
    "svo5005_020": "As a result, I no longer have the omnipotence I once enjoyed.\r\nBut knowledge, I do have.",
    "svo5005_021": "It must have been difficult for you.",
    "svo5005_022": "Still, for me our meeting is rather fortunate.",
    "svo5005_023": "Fortunate? Is that so?",
    "svo5005_024": "Finding myself in this world of which I have no knowledge, far from my friends,\r\nI was helpless to tell the truth.",
    "svo5005_025": "But luckily I ran into someone as knowledgeable as you.\r\nIt's very reassuring.",
    "svo5005_026": "I'm an outsider here. It may be an inconvenience to you,\r\nbut I would very much appreciate your guidance.",
    "svo5005_027": "Very well.\r\nI'll educate you on whatever you need to know.",
    "svo5005_028": "Thoroughly.",
    "svo5005_029": "You have my gratitude.",
    "svo5005_030": "In my former world I lived a calm life with my queen.\r\nWe had been together since we were children, you see.",
    "svo5005_031": "I see. She was a friend from your youth.",
    "svo5005_032": "Yes. Sadly, those days did not last.",
    "svo5005_033": "She—my Titania—was stolen away from me by the hands of a fool.",
    "svo5005_034": "Goodness! Did she pass away?",
    "svo5005_035": "...",
    "svo5005_036": "I'm sorry for your loss.",
    "svo5005_037": "The schemer took my throne and continued to harass me unprovoked.",
    "svo5005_038": "That must have been traumatic.\r\nFeel free to remain silent if it pains you to recall.",
    "svo5005_039": "Thank you for your kindness, Alice.",
    "svo5005_040": "It seems we have visitors.\r\nThe voices don't sound human to me.",
    "svo5005_041": "How ill-mannered of them to interrupt our conversation.\r\nI was quite enjoying our little palaver.",
    "svo5005_042": "Stand back, Your Majesty.",
    "svo5005_043": "Thank you, Alice.\r\nYou are indeed formidable.",
    "svo5005_044": "On the contrary, your spellwords were pivotal in our victory.\r\nI must say I was surprised at their power.",
    "svo5005_045": "They are fitting for the ruler of a world.",
    "svo5005_046": "That was only the most basic of my abilities.\r\nIn truth, I can do much m—",
    "svo5005_047": "Wh-What is that?",
    "svo5005_048": "Enemies? Were they hiding?",
    "svo5005_049": "H-HEEE!",
    "svo5005_050": "Your Majesty! Keep back!",
    "svo5005_051": "Was that the last of them?",
    "svo5005_052": "Your Majesty, are you hurt?",
    "svo5005_053": "Ow! M-My back! Am I dying?!\r\nMy life is flashing before my eyes!",
    "svo5005_054": "Your back?",
    "svo5005_055": "Rest assured, you will be fine.\r\nIt is merely a superficial wound.",
    "svo5005_056": "O-Oh, are you certain?",
    "svo5005_057": "Quite. You are in no mortal danger, I promise.",
    "svo5005_058": "O-Oh. I see. Ha. Hahaha!",
    "svo5005_059": "Oh, silly me! I overreacted quite a bit, it seems. I suppose it was instinct!\r\nIt was quite unexpected, after all!",
    "svo5005_060": "...",
    "svo5005_061": "Well, it seems our foes have been dealt with.\r\nWhy don't we continue our conversation?",
    "svo5005_062": "Of course.",
    "svo5005_063": "Now, where were we?\r\nI had told you about my royal status, yes?",
    "svo5005_064": "Yes. I believe you had mentioned your standing.",
    "svo5005_065": "I believe it is now your turn to share your history.",
    "svo5005_066": "We can't build understanding without knowing each other, don't you agree?",
    "svo5005_067": "I've no argument with that notion. In my world—",
    "svo5005_068": "I see. So you are one of those \"Integrity Knights.\"",
    "svo5005_069": "Yes. We were formed to protect the Human Realm.\r\nAlthough, this was done by overwriting our memories.",
    "svo5005_070": "Hm. You must have suffered greatly.",
    "svo5005_071": "Yes. I have only inklings of things I can't quite recall.\r\nThings that must have been dear to me.",
    "svo5005_072": "I have a feeling I understand how this Pontifex,\r\nthis so-called \"Administrator,\" felt.",
    "svo5005_073": "You condone her actions?",
    "svo5005_074": "As I've told you, I once had a beloved queen to whom I was bound\r\nfrom the carefree days of my childhood.",
    "svo5005_075": "But she was taken from me by that fool to a place beyond my reach.",
    "svo5005_076": "I can't help but envy what she had in the Integrity Knights.",
    "svo5005_077": "I had actually been researching methods to create something similar to them.\r\nIf I'd only had a little more time.",
    "svo5005_078": "Do you mean to say that you were overwriting people's memories\r\nwithout their consent?",
    "svo5005_079": "That is unforgivable! To think that one of your stature would stoop\r\nto such treachery.",
    "svo5005_080": "Unforgivable? Why?\r\nThe world was mine and mine alone.",
    "svo5005_081": "If I had completed my research, I would have been able to control the thoughts,\r\nfeelings, and memories of all of humanity with the flick of a switch!",
    "svo5005_082": "I'm sure this world as well is populated with useless souls\r\nthat would only be so lucky as to be under my dominion!",
    "svo5005_083": "O-Oberon.",
    "svo5005_084": "The same goes for that accursed Black Swordsman!\r\nIf not for his meddling...",
    "svo5005_085": "Titania would be mine.",
    "svo5005_086": "...",
    "svo5005_087": "Oops.",
    "svo5005_088": "You should be ashamed of yourself.\r\nIt seems I misjudged your character.",
    "svo5005_089": "I-I... Allow me to explain.",
    "svo5005_090": "Manipulating the minds of people with no regard for their will is unforgivable,\r\neven for a deity.",
    "svo5005_091": "Doing that would amount to no more than forced obedience.\r\nHow can you be so arrogant?",
    "svo5005_092": "I-Is there a need for you to turn your sword on me.\r\nPl-Please, put it away.",
    "svo5005_093": "You're irredeemable.",
    "svo5005_094": "Pl-Please, let me explain!\r\nIt was merely a slip of the tongue. S-Stop!",
    "svo5005_095": "HEEEEE!",
    "svo5005_096": "I had my doubts based on your reaction when we were attacked earlier,\r\nbut now it is plain to see. You are neither hero nor king!",
    "svo5005_097": "You are nothing but a conceited, pitiful man.",
    "svo5005_098": "H-How dare you—",
    "svo5005_099": "While I would love to liberate your head from your neck this very moment,\r\nI will stay my blade while we are trapped in this strange world.",
    "svo5005_100": "A fine decision! We must cooperate to escape this predicament!",
    "svo5005_101": "Can't we overlook this and work together, Alice?",
    "svo5005_102": "I've no intention of being an accessory to any of your schemes.\r\nAnd I would prefer you NOT use my name in such a casual fashion.",
    "svo5005_103": "O-Of course.",
    "svo5005_104": "I refuse to accompany one so vile as you.\r\nI will continue on my own.",
    "svo5005_105": "W-Wait!\r\nYou're leaving me alone? Surely you must be joking?",
    "svo5005_106": "I do not care for jokes.",
    "svo5005_107": "Wh-What am I to do?",
    "svo5005_108": "You were a king once, yes?\r\nThen, you should be capable of fending for yourself.",
    "svo5005_109": "We really should work together. We need each other.",
    "svo5005_110": "Eeek!",
    "svo5005_111": "You aren't really going to leave me here, are you?",
    "svo5005_112": "Wait!",
    "svo5005_113": "...",
    "svo5005_114": "You're hopeless. I can't believe you call yourself a king.\r\nA king should be a model for his subjects and capable of actually leading.",
    "svo5005_115": "People naturally follow such leaders, as I did my commander.",
    "svo5005_116": "F-Fine, I understand. I'll be better.\r\nSo please, don't leave me here.",
    "svo5005_117": "What knight would abandon a helpless citizen in such a dangerous place?",
    "svo5005_118": "You have a point.\r\nForsaking my principles would keep me awake at night.",
    "svo5005_119": "Do you swear to keep your word then? Will you truly change?",
    "svo5005_120": "Yes! You have my word! I swear it!\r\nNow, let's get out of here!",
    "svo5005_121": "Fine. Come with me then, Oberon.",
    "svo5006_001": "Hey, Argo. What kept you? You had me worried.",
    "svo5006_002": "Welcome back. I'm glad to see you're safe.",
    "svo5006_003": "I mighta gone a bit farther out than expected.\r\nBut it was worth it!",
    "svo5006_004": "Leave it to Argo!",
    "svo5006_005": "This field is crawling with enemies,\r\nbut there's something different about them.",
    "svo5006_006": "There were some players acting weird, too.\r\nForgettin' things.",
    "svo5006_007": "Gotcha. What kind of monsters were there?",
    "svo5006_008": "Depends. How much ya payin'?",
    "svo5006_009": "You can't seriously be thinking about money in a situation like this.",
    "svo5006_010": "Okay, okay, I was just kidding!\r\nThis one's on the house, but just this once!",
    "svo5006_011": "Just this once, huh?\r\nSo next time we'll have to pay?",
    "svo5006_012": "Well of course! Everything's got a price!\r\nAlthough, we don't really have time to talk numbers at the moment.",
    "svo5006_013": "Yep, definitely outta time. Enemies incoming.",
    "svo5006_014": "They don't seem very interested in why we're here.",
    "svo5006_015": "These ones'll be a piece o' cake.",
    "svo5006_016": "All right. Let's take 'em out, Eugeo!",
    "svo5006_017": "Okay!",
    "svo5006_018": "That's all of 'em. You okay, Argo?",
    "svo5006_019": "You know it!",
    "svo5006_020": "Hey, Kirito, can I ask you something?",
    "svo5006_021": "Go for it. What's up?",
    "svo5006_022": "I was wondering, why do we have to pay for information?",
    "svo5006_023": "Aren't we on the same side?",
    "svo5006_024": "Oh, that. Don't let it bother you.\r\nThe cost is how we know it's reliable.",
    "svo5006_025": "Right, Argo?",
    "svo5006_026": "That's one way to think of it.",
    "svo5006_027": "Well, if you didn't charge us, you might be earning your compensation in other\r\nways. Like giving out info about us for instance.",
    "svo5006_028": "Hehe. Who me? Never.\r\nYou are bad at keeping secrets, though.",
    "svo5006_029": "You are good at telling when I'm lying.\r\nI never knew my face was so easy to read.",
    "svo5006_030": "Pffft.",
    "svo5006_031": "What's so funny?",
    "svo5006_032": "Yeah. Ya shouldn't laugh at a lady!",
    "svo5006_033": "Sorry! It's not what you think.",
    "svo5006_034": "What can I say? It's obvious you two really trust each other.\r\nIt gave me a giggle.",
    "svo5006_035": "Trust, huh? Well, you're not wrong.",
    "svo5006_036": "I think out of everyone here, we've known each other the longest.\r\nBesides Leafa, I mean.",
    "svo5006_037": "Oh, really?\r\nDidn't you say you've known that Klein person for a long time, too?",
    "svo5006_038": "Oh, yeah. About as long.",
    "svo5006_039": "I still have him beat though. After all—",
    "svo5006_040": "Argo and I were in the beta together.",
    "svo5006_041": "I didn't expect him to stick around back then.",
    "svo5006_042": "Beta?",
    "svo5006_043": "Oh. It's kind of hard to explain.\r\nThink of it like a sort of rehearsal.",
    "svo5006_044": "Hmm. I see.",
    "svo5006_045": "Putting that aside, Argo,\r\nwhat do you mean you didn't think I'd stick around?",
    "svo5006_046": "I'd like to know, too. You seem to get along so well.",
    "svo5006_047": "Well, ya know. Back then, you—",
    "svo5006_048": "Uh-huh. Uh-huh.",
    "svo5006_049": "...And that's all you get for free.",
    "svo5006_050": "That's it?",
    "svo5006_051": "I can't be givin' away all my valuable information, ya know?\r\nI need compensation!",
    "svo5006_052": "Didn't you say you wouldn't charge us?",
    "svo5006_053": "Kii-boy here is special. There's an extra fee if ya want any dirt on him.",
    "svo5006_054": "How does that make sense? Well, knowing you—",
    "svo5006_055": "But what about me? Do I have to pay for my own information?",
    "svo5006_056": "In this case, ya do. 'Cause this info isn't only about you—\r\nIt happens to be my opinion of you.",
    "svo5006_057": "So we absolutely have to pay?\r\nI wonder if I have enough.",
    "svo5006_058": "I could always take a trade instead. Gimme a story.",
    "svo5006_059": "About me?",
    "svo5006_060": "I'd love to hear about the world you're from.\r\nThat'd be more than enough.",
    "svo5006_061": "Besides a few words they call the Sacred Tongue and some system\r\ncommands called Sacred Arts, everything is basically in Japanese.",
    "svo5006_062": "How's that for a tidbit?",
    "svo5006_063": "Hmm, that is news to me.",
    "svo5006_064": "Do we have a deal then?",
    "svo5006_065": "I'll need more than that.\r\nI need something from Eugeo, too.",
    "svo5006_066": "You really know how to play hardball.",
    "svo5006_067": "It's fine. I don't have anything to hide.\r\nWhat do you want to know?",
    "svo5006_068": "Let's see. How about your relationship with Kii-boy?\r\nBoil it down for me.",
    "svo5006_069": "With Kirito? I don't know. What do you think?",
    "svo5006_070": "Don't ask me. Ball's in your court.",
    "svo5006_071": "Hmmm. We spent a long time together,\r\nbut it's not like we're family.",
    "svo5006_072": "He taught me everything I know about swordplay, so I guess he's like my teacher?\r\nBut he's not very teacherly, either.",
    "svo5006_073": "...",
    "svo5006_074": "I'm not sure what to call him.",
    "svo5006_075": "Partner?",
    "svo5006_076": "Partner. Yeah, I like that!",
    "svo5006_077": "We're partners!",
    "svo5006_078": "Oho, how interesting.\r\nSo ya found yourself a partner, eh Kii-boy?",
    "svo5006_079": "Your relationship with Asu doesn't quite fit the bill.\r\nEugie here might be your first real partner!",
    "svo5006_080": "Really? I'm your first?",
    "svo5006_081": "Guess so.",
    "svo5006_082": "Partners. Huh.",
    "svo5006_083": "What's with that response?",
    "svo5006_084": "Nothing?",
    "svo5006_085": "Hoho, are we a little self-conscious, boys?",
    "svo5006_086": "Well, I'd say that's enough for a trade.\r\nInterpersonal relations sure are a lucrative business! Hehe!",
    "svo5006_087": "You wanna hear what I've got on Kii-boy?\r\nGet this. Back in the beta he—",
    "svo5006_088": "He what?",
    "svo5006_089": "He was an unmitigated loner! Total solo player!",
    "svo5006_090": "Loner? Solo? I'm not very good with the Sacred Tongue. Can you explain?",
    "svo5006_091": "It means he stayed all by himself.",
    "svo5006_092": "All by himself...?",
    "svo5006_093": "He ran everything solo.\r\nDidn't even try to get along with the other players.",
    "svo5006_094": "Are you sure you're talking about this Kirito?\r\nHe was never like that with me or Ronie or Liena.",
    "svo5006_095": "A lot happened and I grew up, can we drop it?",
    "svo5006_096": "Hey, you're the one who wanted to hear what I know, weren't ya? No refunds.",
    "svo5006_097": "Kirito, lonely...?",
    "svo5006_098": "Was I really that bad?\r\n...Yeah, guess I was.",
    "svo5006_099": "Hehe, the loner admits it.",
    "svo5006_100": "Anyway, it's clear that you two are close.\r\nIt's obvious when you fight together in battle, too.",
    "svo5006_101": "That's true! He is reliable!",
    "svo5006_102": "In battle, anyway.",
    "svo5006_103": "You had to go there, didn't you?",
    "svo5006_104": "You've got no backbone outside of battle.\r\nWhy do ya think I call ya \"boy\"?",
    "svo5006_105": "What do you mean?",
    "svo5006_106": "I think I was bein' chased by ninjas on Floor 2 of Aincrad.",
    "svo5006_107": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not bring up that incident!",
    "svo5006_108": "See? No backbone.\r\nAnd what a terrible thing he did to her.",
    "svo5006_109": "You don't have to make it sound so bad!",
    "svo5006_110": "Haha. You really are close. I'm a little jealous.",
    "svo5006_111": "But you've been together a long time, too.\r\nYou even called him your partner.",
    "svo5006_112": "You're right. It's like we belong together.",
    "svo5006_113": "We're together when we eat, when we sleep, basically every day.",
    "svo5006_114": "Maybe I should start calling you Kii-boy, too?\r\nI've always wanted to have a nickname for someone.",
    "svo5006_115": "Don't you start with the \"boy\" thing, too!\r\nWe're practically the same age!",
    "svo5006_116": "But you're just like a child!\r\nAlways getting into trouble and sneaking snacks.",
    "svo5006_117": "Once you notice that, it's hard to see anything else.",
    "svo5006_118": "Th-That's—\r\nWell, you have a point, but still! Spare me the \"Kii-boy\" business!",
    "svo5006_119": "Or else I'll start calling you \"Eugie-boy\"!",
    "svo5006_120": "I don't mind.",
    "svo5006_121": "Urk.",
    "svo5006_122": "Argo.",
    "svo5006_123": "What can I do ya for, Kii-boy?",
    "svo5006_124": "You'd better not be planning on offering this conversation\r\nas one of your hot items.",
    "svo5006_125": "Hehe. If it sells, it sells.\r\nWho am I to withhold information from my valued customers? You know my motto.",
    "svo5006_126": "It's fine, Kirito. No one would pay for it anyway.",
    "svo5006_127": "Hehe.",
    "svo5007_001": "Time for a break?",
    "svo5007_002": "Good idea.\r\nThere don't seem to be any enemies around.",
    "svo5007_003": "I'd say we're about 70% of the way there.\r\nAlmost done.",
    "svo5007_004": "It's gone well so far.\r\nAll we have left is that forest.",
    "svo5007_005": "Yup. Let's chow down before we finish up.",
    "svo5007_006": "Can't fight on an empty stomach.",
    "svo5007_007": "Oh, I think I've heard Kirito say that before.\r\nI like that one.",
    "svo5007_008": "Yeah, he might be even more of a pig than me.",
    "svo5007_009": "You've known each other for a long time, right?",
    "svo5007_010": "You could say that. We're not exactly stuck to each other like glue,\r\nbut we've been buds for a while.",
    "svo5007_011": "At times we've worked together, and others we've gone our separate ways.\r\nHe's as wild and untamed as me.",
    "svo5007_012": "It sounds like you've had nice adventures.\r\nI'm envious.",
    "svo5007_013": "Nothing to be jealous about. Me and Kirito...\r\nWe've got a love-hate relationship.",
    "svo5007_014": "Besides, you and him are longtime friends too, right?\r\nBasically spent every day together for two whole years.",
    "svo5007_015": "Well, yes, but...",
    "svo5007_016": "That's not easy to pull off.",
    "svo5007_017": "I'm glad.\r\nIt's good to see he made a bud that stuck by him.",
    "svo5007_018": "\"Bud\"? Am I his bud?",
    "svo5007_019": "Back in SAO, he soloed for a long time.\r\nHe wasn't interested in partying up with me or anyone else.",
    "svo5007_020": "It was dangerous. I tried to tell him it'd be for his own good,\r\nbut it didn't take. Asuna, was the only one who could change his mind.",
    "svo5007_021": "Asuna's not exactly a bud though.",
    "svo5007_022": "She does know him better than anyone, though.",
    "svo5007_023": "The guy shoulders everything himself.\r\nEven when he's hurtin', he refuses to rely on anyone.",
    "svo5007_024": "It's like he's afraid of anyone figurin' out how he feels.\r\nAt times, he'd push everyone away and just seethe in the pain.",
    "svo5007_025": "He did? This doesn't sound anything like the Kirito I know.",
    "svo5007_026": "The Kirito I know is kind to everyone. He treats his page well, too.\r\nAlthough he does keep her waiting a lot.",
    "svo5007_027": "He got through to me when I wasn't sure of myself\r\nand broke me out of my unfulfilling life. Brought me to the capital.",
    "svo5007_028": "Still can't believe Kirito took someone under his wing.\r\nNever expected that one.",
    "svo5007_029": "He does still tend to take responsibility for everything though.\r\nThat I understand.",
    "svo5007_030": "Haha! You got that right.\r\nSometimes he gives off this don't-come-near-me aura.",
    "svo5007_031": "Haha. He sure does.",
    "svo5007_032": "But by the time I met him he was already the kind Kirito I know now.\r\nThat means you and his other friends must have been the ones that changed him.",
    "svo5007_033": "Hm, I dunno...\r\nI mean, I'm sure the rest of us played some part.",
    "svo5007_034": "But Asuna was the big one.\r\nAnd I think you've had as much of an effect on him as she did.",
    "svo5007_035": "Me? I don't know. It doesn't feel like I have.",
    "svo5007_036": "You did, believe me.\r\nHe's gotten a lot stronger thanks to you.",
    "svo5007_037": "It's like he's got more courage. Doesn't back down from what he's gotta do,\r\nI guess. Wish I had the words to put it better than that.",
    "svo5007_038": "You think?",
    "svo5007_039": "Whelp, looks like chat time is over.\r\nWe've got enemies.",
    "svo5007_040": "It's no small number, either! Be careful, Klein!",
    "svo5007_041": "You know it, my man!",
    "svo5007_042": "I think we're out of the woods!",
    "svo5007_043": "There don't seem to be any more enemies in the area.",
    "svo5007_044": "You really know your way around a sword, man.",
    "svo5007_045": "You're a skilled fighter yourself.\r\nYou had no trouble dealing with multiple enemies at once.",
    "svo5007_046": "I'm used to these kinds of fights.",
    "svo5007_047": "We always fought monsters more often than humans.\r\nPlus, I do have my own guild.",
    "svo5007_048": "So I have plenty of experience with group-on-group battles.",
    "svo5007_049": "That sounds nice.\r\nI usually only fight by myself or with Kirito.",
    "svo5007_050": "And usually only against one or two opponents.\r\nI'm not accustomed to the battles in this world.",
    "svo5007_051": "In that case, I'd be glad to give you some tips.\r\nIt's not too hard.",
    "svo5007_052": "I'm sure the others'll help, too.\r\nKiridude's the only one who prefers to fight solo or in a pair.",
    "svo5007_053": "Really? That'd be great!",
    "svo5007_054": "Now I won't be a burden on everyone.",
    "svo5007_055": "Nah, you're plenty strong enough even if your party play is a little off.",
    "svo5007_056": "So don't worry about it too much.\r\nAnd remember you can ask me any time.",
    "svo5007_057": "I will! Thanks, Klein!",
    "svo5007_058": "One more thing. It might be my imagination, but—",
    "svo5007_059": "What's eatin' ya? Spill it, man.",
    "svo5007_060": "Okay. Well, your fighting style reminds me of Kirito's.\r\nDo you practice Aincrad Style, too?",
    "svo5007_061": "\"A-Aincrad Style\"? What's that?\r\nSome kinda sword fighting style?",
    "svo5007_062": "Yes. Kirito taught it to me.\r\nIt's a set of swordsmanship principles and secret techniques.",
    "svo5007_063": "I wasn't able to wield a sword until relatively recently.",
    "svo5007_064": "Dang, and you got this good that fast? And you call it Aincrad Style, huh?\r\nWhat about the secret moves?",
    "svo5007_065": "Kirito taught me a few.\r\nLike a jumping attack where you hold the sword above your head and kick.",
    "svo5007_066": "Oh, that's Sonic Leap. These \"secret moves\" you're talkin' about\r\nmust be Sword Skills. I saw you use some in the battle back there.",
    "svo5007_067": "Man, what're you teachin' people, Kiridude?",
    "svo5007_068": "Did you say something?",
    "svo5007_069": "Just thinking to myself.\r\nBut, by how you described it, I guess I do use this Aincrad Style.",
    "svo5007_070": "I thought so!\r\nI'm glad to have met another student of Aincrad!",
    "svo5007_071": "My style might look like his, but they're actually pretty different.\r\nFor starters, I use a different weapon.",
    "svo5007_072": "So let's call my style \"The Fuurinkazan School of Aincrad Style.\"",
    "svo5007_073": "\"Fuurinkazan\"? Wh-What's that? Is it good?",
    "svo5007_074": "Sure is! That's not even an exaggeration!",
    "svo5007_075": "I don't think so, anyway. Kirito probably wouldn't agree.",
    "svo5007_076": "I see. I'd like to learn this Fuurinkazan thing.",
    "svo5007_077": "Ya don't say. Well, I'd be happy to show ya the ropes.\r\nI'm a pretty big name when it comes to using a katana.",
    "svo5007_078": "You don't mind? Thanks, Klein!",
    "svo5007_079": "I still have to get used to fighting here, so every bit of practice helps.",
    "svo5007_080": "That's what I like to hear!\r\nThe katana's a man's weapon, man.",
    "svo5007_081": "Welcome back, guys.",
    "svo5007_082": "Hi, Kirito.",
    "svo5007_083": "Yo. Back already?",
    "svo5007_084": "Just got here. How were things on your end?",
    "svo5007_085": "Smooth as silk.",
    "svo5007_086": "Thanks to Klein. He made quick work of the enemies.",
    "svo5007_087": "I was impressed at how quick you picked up my techniques.",
    "svo5007_088": "Sounds like you two have gotten close.\r\nHow'd that happen?",
    "svo5007_089": "Hehe. Nothing in particular.",
    "svo5007_090": "Yeah, everything's the same as ever. Right? Hahaha.",
    "svo5007_091": "You're on the same wavelength.\r\nSomething's definitely fishy.",
    "svo5007_092": "Why the sour face? Are you jealous?",
    "svo5007_093": "I'm not jealous.",
    "svo5007_094": "Come on, Kiridude, don't get all bent out of shape.\r\nI'll teach you, too.",
    "svo5007_095": "Yeah, you can learn our style!",
    "svo5009_001": "My scouting above turned up no signs of enemies, but there is an open body of water ahead.",
    "svo5009_002": "Although no enemies were spotted, we should remain on guard.\r\nMonsters tend to gather around water.",
    "svo5009_003": "I should thank you.",
    "svo5009_004": "This forest's thick vegetation makes for quite low visibility,\r\nbut your flight affords us the ability to bypass that obstacle.",
    "svo5009_005": "What are you getting at?",
    "svo5009_006": "Whatever do you mean?",
    "svo5009_007": "The flattery. It's unnecessary.",
    "svo5009_008": "I apologize if it sounded so, but you misunderstand.\r\nI was sincerely complimenting your ability.",
    "svo5009_009": "If not for your presence,\r\nour mission to survey the area would have been greatly impeded.",
    "svo5009_010": "Is that so?",
    "svo5009_011": "Wouldn't you agree, Death Gun?",
    "svo5009_012": "...",
    "svo5009_013": "Well, I suppose it's only natural.\r\nI am the former apex male of ALO, after all!",
    "svo5009_014": "Guiding the lower classes is my duty.\r\nOh, how difficult we at the top have it.",
    "svo5009_015": "Since you are so familiar with ALO,\r\nI would have you take charge during the operation. Any objections, Death Gun?",
    "svo5009_016": "...",
    "svo5009_017": "He seems to be in agreement.\r\nI'm sorry to ask this of you, Sugou.",
    "svo5009_018": "I suppose I have no choice.\r\nLet's move on to the watering hole!",
    "svo5009_019": "We're almost at the watering hole.\r\nEveryone, be on the lookout for enemies.",
    "svo5009_020": "Understood.",
    "svo5009_021": "Heh.",
    "svo5009_022": "Ahhh!",
    "svo5009_023": "There they are.",
    "svo5009_024": "Hahaha! Just as I said!",
    "svo5009_025": "Death Gun, you aim for the ones in the air.",
    "svo5009_026": "What will you do, Sugou?",
    "svo5009_027": "I'll take to the sky, fight there, and observe the state of battle.",
    "svo5009_028": "Understood. Be careful up there.",
    "svo5009_029": "That's my line.\r\nAlthough, you'll be fine so long as you follow my orders!",
    "svo5009_030": "Bahahaha! How do you like that?\r\nThanks to my leadership, these foes were rendered powerless!",
    "svo5009_031": "Indeed, you were well-versed on the enemies' traits and weaknesses.\r\nYou outdid yourself, Sugou.",
    "svo5009_032": "...",
    "svo5009_033": "Well, of course I did.\r\nI am, after all, the King of ALO.",
    "svo5009_034": "It seems there won't be any more enemies.\r\nSo let's keep moving.",
    "svo5009_035": "Our goal this time is to get a grasp on this forest's position,\r\nas well as enemy tendencies!",
    "svo5009_036": "We know.",
    "svo5009_038": "I will say, these woods are really quite dense.\r\nIf only there were some form of landmark to go by.",
    "svo5009_039": "Hmph. I'll take to the skies and search, then.",
    "svo5009_040": "That would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
    "svo5009_041": "...",
    "svo5009_042": "Were you wounded in that last fight?\r\nThere were a lot of them, and they caught us off guard.",
    "svo5009_043": "I'm fine.",
    "svo5009_044": "Oh, here, let me heal your wounds.\r\nI doubt either of you can use healing spells.",
    "svo5009_045": "...",
    "svo5009_046": "...",
    "svo5009_047": "...",
    "svo5009_048": "...?!",
    "svo5009_049": "Y-You've been taking advantage of me! Both of you!",
    "svo5009_050": "Where is this coming from?",
    "svo5009_051": "I've been the only one doing anything from the start.\r\nYou haven't lifted a finger!",
    "svo5009_052": "Now that's not true.\r\nWe've lifted several fingers to fight when enemies showed up.",
    "svo5009_053": "Only because I gave you orders to do so!",
    "svo5009_054": "Which is, in fact, what you told us to do.\r\nYou yourself said to follow your orders.",
    "svo5009_055": "Forgot your own words?",
    "svo5009_056": "Arghhh!",
    "svo5009_057": "I believe we've gained some insight about the forest.",
    "svo5009_058": "Let's head back and give our report.\r\nSee if we can find a safer route than the watering hole,\r\nwhile we're at it.",
    "svo5009_059": "I-I was just about to suggest that!",
    "svo5009_060": "True. More reconnaissance makes no sense.\r\nWe know how strong the enemies are.",
    "svo5009_061": "Right. And there's no sign of giant monsters, so the threat level is fairly low.\r\nGranted, that's not to say we can be careless.",
    "svo5009_062": "Hey! I'm still here!",
    "svo5009_063": "Curse them! Belittling me like that.",
    "svo5009_064": "I am the king of this world.\r\nAnd they don't even—",
    "svo5009_065": "...",
    "svo5009_066": "That said, we must give credit where it's due.\r\nWe couldn't have finished our reconnaissance this quickly without you, Sugou.",
    "svo5009_067": "...",
    "svo5009_068": "As one might expect of the Fairy King of ALO,\r\nyou expertly did all that which we could not.",
    "svo5009_069": "...",
    "svo5009_070": "Would you not agree, Death Gun?",
    "svo5009_071": "...",
    "svo5009_072": "That's the king for ya.",
    "svo5009_073": "Do you really mean that?\r\n",
    "svo5009_074": "But of course.\r\nWere it only the two of us, we'd still be surveying the area- of that I'm sure.",
    "svo5009_075": "Exactly! I'm glad you can see that!",
    "svo5009_076": "Well, feel free to seek out the great Fairy King Oberon whenever your heart desires!",
    "svo5009_077": "So we shall.",
    "svo5009_078": "...",
    "svo5010_001": "Wow. That was incredible.",
    "svo5010_002": "Thanks for singing such an awesome song for me, Yuna.",
    "svo5010_003": "Hee hee. No, thank YOU for listening.",
    "svo5010_004": "Your songs have a way of lifting spirits.\r\nIt's strange.",
    "svo5010_005": "I mean, you're a great singer and everything.\r\nBut it's like there's more to it than that.",
    "svo5010_006": "I'm happy you think so. There's nothing I like more than making people happy\r\nor cheering them up with my songs.",
    "svo5010_007": "You're a really popular singer, right?\r\nI've no idea what kind of music is popular these days.",
    "svo5010_008": "I don't think it really matters what's popular or getting a lot of play.\r\nI'm just happy you'd listen to me.",
    "svo5010_009": "Aw, thanks! Well, you've made a fan of me today!",
    "svo5010_010": "Then, how about another song for my newest fan—",
    "svo5010_011": "Sorry, Yuna. Hold on.\r\nFootsteps! Something's coming.",
    "svo5010_012": "Monsters, more than likely.",
    "svo5010_013": "I hear them, too.\r\nGosh, they must be some rude monsters to be interrupting my concert.",
    "svo5010_014": "Get behind me, Yuna.\r\nThere don't seem to be a lot so let's take 'em out between the two of us!",
    "svo5010_015": "Okay! I'll pump you up with a song!",
    "svo5010_016": "That was amazing, Yuuki!\r\nYou beat 'em all up in a flash!",
    "svo5010_017": "All thanks to the support you gave me with your singing.\r\nIt made it way easier than usual to fight.",
    "svo5010_018": "So, yeah, it wasn't just me.\r\nWe thrashed them as a team!",
    "svo5010_019": "Hee hee.\r\nIt's because those who hear my songs get their attack power buffed.",
    "svo5010_020": "Sure, there is that. But it wasn't just stats making it easier to fight.\r\nIt felt like your voice was giving me a push.",
    "svo5010_021": "I think your songs have a power to them beyond the buffs.",
    "svo5010_022": "Thank you.\r\nNothing makes me happier than getting compliments for my songs.",
    "svo5010_023": "Guess what, Yuuki.\r\nAs thanks for the kind words, I'm gonna sing your favorite song.",
    "svo5010_024": "You are?!",
    "svo5010_025": "Oh, but like I said earlier, I don't really know what's popular these days.\r\nI don't even know the song you were singing.",
    "svo5010_026": "It doesn't have to be one of mine.\r\nIf you have a favorite song, let me know. I'll sing it if I know it.",
    "svo5010_027": "Hmm.",
    "svo5010_028": "Oh, yeah!\r\nYou know, I really like Mother Goose lullabies!",
    "svo5010_029": "But maybe you're not familiar with those.",
    "svo5010_030": "Mother Goose lullabies, huh?",
    "svo5010_031": "Yeah! My sister used to sing them for me all the time.",
    "svo5010_032": "They were originally the songs my mother sang for us.\r\nI loved falling asleep to them.",
    "svo5010_033": "I see.",
    "svo5010_034": "Guess you don't know them, after all.\r\nMaybe they're a bit old.",
    "svo5010_035": "It's not that. I could sing one. It's just—",
    "svo5010_036": "What's wrong?",
    "svo5010_037": "Even if I sang those songs, they wouldn't, you know,\r\nfeel the way they did when you heard them in the past.",
    "svo5010_038": "How come? You're such a good singer.\r\nSeriously, your voice is incredible!",
    "svo5010_039": "Thanks. I appreciate you saying that.\r\nBut no matter how good I may be, it won't be the same.",
    "svo5010_040": "I think lullabies are the sweetest songs in the world.",
    "svo5010_041": "Sweetest?",
    "svo5010_042": "They're almost like prayers sung so the person you love will sleep peacefully\r\nand have sweet dreams. Don't you think so?",
    "svo5010_043": "Like a hymn?",
    "svo5010_044": "Yeah, so if I sang it for you, it would probably remind you of your youth.",
    "svo5010_045": "But I doubt it would tug at your heartstrings the way your mother's lullabies\r\ndid. You know?",
    "svo5010_046": "Oh, you're probably right.",
    "svo5010_047": "How about this, then?\r\nNext time, why don't you sing a song for someone special to you?",
    "svo5010_048": "What?! Me? Sing?!",
    "svo5010_049": "Singing, huh?\r\nI can't say I've sung in front of people much.",
    "svo5010_050": "Give it a shot.\r\nI just know you'll enjoy it if you try.",
    "svo5010_051": "Really?",
    "svo5010_052": "Come here.",
    "svo5010_053": "Uh, what? Wait.",
    "svo5010_054": "Hey, it's Asuna! She's back!",
    "svo5010_055": "I'm back.",
    "svo5010_056": "Welcome back! Perfect timing!",
    "svo5010_057": "Huh? What's up? Did any monsters appear?",
    "svo5010_058": "No, that's not it.",
    "svo5010_059": "Well, there were some, but Yuuki made short work of them.",
    "svo5010_060": "So, there were monsters.\r\nI came across some nearby, so I hurried back.",
    "svo5010_061": "Really? Were you okay? Did you get hurt?",
    "svo5010_062": "Oh, I'm fine. But I did fend them off myself and then I ran here,\r\nso I guess I'm a little tired.",
    "svo5010_063": "Gotcha. Thanks for worrying about us.",
    "svo5010_064": "Yeah, thanks, Asuna!",
    "svo5010_065": "Oh, that's right! Should I sing you a lullaby?",
    "svo5010_066": "What?",
    "svo5010_067": "A lullaby. It's one of my favorite songs, too.",
    "svo5010_068": "Ooh, that's a good idea.\r\nI bet you'd perk right up if she sang it for you.",
    "svo5010_069": "You think so? But it's a lullaby, so I wonder if I'd fall asleep.",
    "svo5010_070": "Why not? You can lay your head on my lap.",
    "svo5010_071": "What?! Right here?!",
    "svo5010_072": "Why not? Let her spoil you a bit.",
    "svo5010_073": "Oh, Yuna, what were you two up to, huh?",
    "svo5010_074": "Hehehe!\r\nAll right, Asuna. Get ready for your tiredness to magically disappear.",
    "svo5015_001": "Coast is clear over here, Leafa.",
    "svo5015_002": "I'm back!\r\nI was watching from the air and things looked clear to me, too!",
    "svo5015_003": "Whoa. Cool.",
    "svo5015_004": "Hm? You okay, LLENN?",
    "svo5015_005": "Oh, sorry. You just looked insanely cool when you flew down from the sky.",
    "svo5015_006": "I knew about ALO but flying really does look awesome when you see it up close.",
    "svo5015_007": "Hehe, thanks! Flying is the biggest draw to ALO, after all.",
    "svo5015_008": "It's my favorite thing, too.\r\nSo being praised for it makes me really happy.",
    "svo5015_009": "You look incredibly cool when you fly! You're as fast as a fighter jet.\r\nI almost lose you entirely.",
    "svo5015_010": "A fighter jet? That's funny. Hehehe.\r\nThat's what I look like, huh?",
    "svo5015_011": "Heck, I was running at full speed earlier,\r\nafraid you might leave me in the dust.",
    "svo5015_012": "So, that's why you were going that fast!",
    "svo5015_013": "To be honest, I was also putting the pedal to the metal, so I wouldn't lose you.",
    "svo5015_014": "Hahaha, we were both doing the same thing!",
    "svo5015_015": "You're just so small and fast. From the sky, you look like some ultra-fast bunny.",
    "svo5015_016": "Not some regular bunny, of course.\r\nYou've survived GGO, so you're more like a mega-strong bunny!",
    "svo5015_017": "A bunny! I like it. I'm tiny and cute!",
    "svo5015_018": "Still, there's no way I could compete with some as fast\r\nas a fighter jet at a rabbit's pace.",
    "svo5015_019": "No way! You are amazingly fast!",
    "svo5015_020": "What?! You're way faster than me, though.",
    "svo5015_021": "No way! You are so fast!",
    "svo5015_022": "And you're faster!",
    "svo5015_023": "You are absolutely faster!",
    "svo5015_024": "No, you are!",
    "svo5015_025": "Grrr.",
    "svo5015_026": "Excuse me! Pipe down!",
    "svo5015_027": "We're having a conversation!",
    "svo5015_028": "Honestly!\r\nIf you're gonna barge in, at least read the room a little bit!",
    "svo5015_029": "Right?\r\nWe were just about to decide who's faster.",
    "svo5015_030": "...",
    "svo5015_031": "...",
    "svo5015_032": "We got a little excited back there, didn't we?",
    "svo5015_033": "Hehehe! Yeah, we kinda did.",
    "svo5015_034": "I'm sorry, Leafa. I shouldn't have gotten so riled up.",
    "svo5015_035": "No, no, I'm the one who's sorry.\r\nYou're just so awesome that I couldn't help but get worked up.",
    "svo5015_036": "Me? You're the cool one!",
    "svo5015_037": "Even in that fight earlier, when we teamed up, it felt great going that fast.",
    "svo5015_038": "Heck, that battle was so fast, we were basically melting our enemies.",
    "svo5015_039": "Huh. Yeah, it did sorta feel like that.",
    "svo5015_040": "You know what, LLENN?\r\nI had an idea while we were fighting.",
    "svo5015_041": "Since both of us have mastered speed,\r\nI have a feeling we could come up with a new way to fight.",
    "svo5015_042": "Ooh, that's something we could really only do in a world like this.\r\nIt sounds super fun!",
    "svo5015_043": "For sure! I was thinking that if we're gonna come up with new tactics to try together, it's kinda now or never.",
    "svo5015_044": "Oh, so, how's this?",
    "svo5015_045": "A classic air and ground double-team attack?!",
    "svo5015_046": "Yes! I think that'd be really effective.\r\nIt's hard handling simultaneous attacks from varying heights.",
    "svo5015_047": "I know I brought it up, but I think I'd definitely be in trouble\r\nif I was attacked like that.",
    "svo5015_048": "You're telling me! It's no surprise you're one of the survivors\r\nof the notorious GGO!",
    "svo5015_049": "Ooh! How about this?",
    "svo5015_050": "I carry you, flying low to the ground,\r\nthen quickly sweep in on the enemy and drop you right on them!",
    "svo5015_051": "A preemptive strike, eh?\r\nThat way I quickly knock 'em out!",
    "svo5015_052": "Exactly! I was thinking you're really well-suited for surprise attacks\r\n'cause you're so tiny!",
    "svo5015_053": "That's actually a very fighter jet-like way of attacking, isn't it?\r\nSo cool... And more importantly, fun!",
    "svo5015_054": "Well, you know how you said I looked like a fighter jet earlier?\r\nThat's what gave me the idea.",
    "svo5015_055": "I think it's a great strategy seeing as it combines both of our specialties\r\nso well.",
    "svo5015_056": "Hmm, I'd love to give it a test run right away.",
    "svo5015_057": "But there's another thing I thought of and wanna try.",
    "svo5015_058": "Me, too. And I keep getting more ideas than I know what to do with.",
    "svo5015_059": "Hmm, which should we start with?",
    "svo5015_060": "Okay, here me out. Why don't we try all of them?",
    "svo5015_061": "What? All of them?",
    "svo5015_062": "All of them!",
    "svo5015_063": "Don't worry!\r\nWith our speed, we'll get through everything before you know it!",
    "svo5015_064": "Heehee. This is gonna be so fun!",
    "svo5015_065": "All right. Wanna find some enemies to raid?!",
    "svo5015_066": "Let's do it!",
    "svo5016_001": "Asuna, we've gotten fairly close to our destination.\r\nI wouldn't be surprised by an enemy attack at this point.",
    "svo5016_002": "I was just thinking the same thing.",
    "svo5016_003": "Do you sense anything, Commander?",
    "svo5016_004": "...",
    "svo5016_005": "Hmm. I don't yet sense any attacks, no.",
    "svo5016_006": "All the same, I propose remaining alert as we proceed.\r\nAny objections, Kirito?",
    "svo5016_007": "Oh, no. None from me.",
    "svo5016_008": "...",
    "svo5016_009": "Yes, let's follow the commander's judgment and keep an eye on our surroundings,\r\nshall we?",
    "svo5016_010": "Um, this is entirely unrelated, but may I ask something?",
    "svo5016_012": "What exactly is your relationship to Asuna and Kirito?",
    "svo5016_013": "A-Alice?",
    "svo5016_014": "I feel as though you act differently toward them than you do our other allies.",
    "svo5016_015": "As if you can't entirely trust them.\r\nAt least, that's the impression I get.",
    "svo5016_016": "I see. You're concerned for them as their ally.\r\nAnd more importantly, as a good friend.",
    "svo5016_017": "This is quite interesting.",
    "svo5016_018": "What is?",
    "svo5016_019": "Oh, don't mind my ramblings.\r\nGiving it a second look brought a lot of ideas to mind.",
    "svo5016_020": "Allow me to answer your question, then.\r\nIn Asuna's case, we were once affiliated with the same order of knights.",
    "svo5016_022": "...I see.",
    "svo5016_023": "As for how Kirito and I are connected...",
    "svo5016_024": "I could offer an explanation.\r\nHowever, I believe it best you heard it directly from him.",
    "svo5016_025": "Is that how it's gonna be?",
    "svo5016_026": "I don't think I should speak so lightly regarding your sentiments on the matter.",
    "svo5016_027": "Right. Yeah, you're right.",
    "svo5016_028": "A lot happened a good while back.",
    "svo5016_029": "It's a pretty long story, but—",
    "svo5016_030": "Heads up, everyone! Enemy attack!",
    "svo5016_031": "Prepare for battle, everybody.",
    "svo5016_032": "That should do it.",
    "svo5016_033": "We have Kirito and I, plus Alice and the commander.\r\nI must say, I feel pretty safe in this party.",
    "svo5016_034": "Alice and Asuna, you were comboing really well together.\r\nYou haven't actually fought together all that much, have you?",
    "svo5016_035": "It's true we haven't battled much together,\r\nbut Asuna was kind enough to fight in a way that was easy to work with.",
    "svo5016_036": "You were the one attacking with unerring precision, Alice.\r\nFighting alongside you was a breeze.",
    "svo5016_037": "As one might expect from two of the best Clearers,\r\nas well as an Integrity Knight.",
    "svo5016_038": "As if you didn't also outdo yourself, Heathcliff the Divine Blade.\r\nEven in this world, you're as skilled as ever.",
    "svo5016_039": "I'm only glad I haven't grown too rusty.",
    "svo5016_040": "Incidentally, Heathcliff...\r\nMight I ask why you kept glancing in my direction during the fight?",
    "svo5016_041": "Forgive me. You had such excellent technique that you continued to draw my eye.",
    "svo5016_042": "Excellent? I merely displayed what would be expected of any Integrity Knight.\r\nUnless... You're not mocking me, are you?",
    "svo5016_043": "Not in the least.",
    "svo5016_044": "...",
    "svo5016_045": "Kirito, does this Heathcliff truly live up to all you say of him?",
    "svo5016_046": "Well, I can vouch for his abilities.",
    "svo5016_047": "That statement reeks of implications, doesn't it?",
    "svo5016_048": "Did it come across like that?",
    "svo5016_049": "Can we please keep our tempers in check in a place like this, everyone?",
    "svo5016_050": "Alice, we may not see eye to eye with the commander on a lot of things.\r\nEven so, his swordsmanship is the real deal.",
    "svo5016_051": "I've seen it firsthand, and it's overwhelmed me time and again.",
    "svo5016_052": "I suppose I have yet to spot any gaps in his behavior.",
    "svo5016_053": "And it's clear he is not the kind of swordsman that would be outdone\r\nby the sort of enemies we fought earlier.",
    "svo5016_054": "I'm glad you understand. Well, then...",
    "svo5016_055": "As such, I would test those abilities myself, if that is all right.",
    "svo5016_056": "What?!",
    "svo5016_057": "I cannot judge you after a single battle together.\r\nI would take the measure of your abilities in a duel.",
    "svo5016_058": "And above all else, Heathcliff, I want to see for myself the strength\r\nthose two so highly regard.",
    "svo5016_059": "I see you have a vested interest in strength, as well as your own ambitions.\r\nI, too, am curious about your swordsmanship.",
    "svo5016_060": "Now hold on a second, Commander. You too?!",
    "svo5016_061": "Oh, let 'em be. They both seem bent on doing this.",
    "svo5016_062": "Kirito!\r\nYou want to see this play out just as much, don't you?",
    "svo5016_063": "Listen, they'll be fine.\r\nThere shouldn't be any trouble if we watch them.",
    "svo5016_064": "Good grief. Try not to take it too far, Alice.",
    "svo5016_065": "Right, then. If you would do me the honor.",
    "svo5016_066": "The honor is mine.",
    "svo5016_067": "Are you ready?",
    "svo5016_068": "Ready when you are.",
    "svo5016_069": "Then, here I go.",
    "svo5016_070": "Hyah!",
    "svo5016_071": "I see. Good swordsmanship. Proper and direct. Hah!",
    "svo5016_072": "Eh? He countered with his shield?!",
    "svo5016_073": "Is she gonna be okay?",
    "svo5016_074": "You're worrying too much. Watch.",
    "svo5016_075": "Let's see how you handle this!",
    "svo5016_076": "Yaaah!",
    "svo5016_077": "You have more than sheer force. Your attacks are sharp and aimed with precision.\r\nIt's clear your skills have been polished to the extreme.",
    "svo5016_078": "As we spar, I can see your sword skills are far sharper than they first appeared.",
    "svo5016_079": "Don't limit yourself to your blade, Alice. This is not a chance\r\nwe'll have often. Let's see all you have to offer in battle.",
    "svo5016_080": "I truly won't be able to hold back, though.\r\nWould you still have me do it?",
    "svo5016_081": "By all means.",
    "svo5016_082": "Very well. System Call!",
    "svo5016_083": "She's even using Sacred Arts now!",
    "svo5016_084": "They're really getting into it, huh?",
    "svo5016_085": "How fascinating. Was that a Sacred Art?",
    "svo5016_086": "You're quite knowledgeable. Seems it'll take more than that.\r\nHow about this?",
    "svo5016_087": "Enhance Armament!",
    "svo5016_088": "Dance, my blossoms!",
    "svo5016_089": "Ah, there it is. This is your trump card, I take it.\r\nThen, if you'll allow me...",
    "svo5016_090": "Okay, now that's actually dangerous.",
    "svo5016_091": "Kirito!",
    "svo5016_092": "On it!",
    "svo5016_093": "That's far enough!",
    "svo5016_094": "Kirito! Why did you stop us?!",
    "svo5016_095": "You've each seen what the other can do by now, haven't you?",
    "svo5016_096": "If you keep going, one of you—maybe both—\r\nare going to take serious damage.",
    "svo5016_097": "I'm still perfectly—",
    "svo5016_098": "He is correct. Let's call it there, shall we?",
    "svo5016_099": "Alice, are you okay?! Did you get hurt?",
    "svo5016_100": "No, I'm fine. Heathcliff isn't hurt either, is he?",
    "svo5016_101": "I swung my sword with abandon, yet he stopped every one of my attacks.",
    "svo5016_102": "Those who can get through that shield to hit him are few and far between.\r\nPhew. I was sweating bullets over here.",
    "svo5016_103": "She was one of the residents of Underworld, wasn't she?",
    "svo5016_104": "And she wasn't the only one of her kind.\r\nThey were all like her there, correct?",
    "svo5016_105": "Yeah.\r\nGranted, I doubt there were many as strong and noble as her.",
    "svo5016_106": "But in that world, everyone had a kind of humanness to them.",
    "svo5016_107": "Even the goblins, orcs, and all the other demihumans...\r\nThat's the kind of world it is.",
    "svo5016_108": "I see.",
    "svo5016_109": "I would've liked to interact with the people who live there,\r\nas you and your friends did.",
    "svo5016_110": "I was thinking of how happy it would've made you to witness it.",
    "svo5016_111": "Okay, it looks like you don't have any injuries.",
    "svo5016_112": "Did I not already tell you I wasn't hurt?",
    "svo5016_113": "You could've been hurt and not realized it. It happens, you know!\r\nNot to mention, you were fighting the commander, of all people.",
    "svo5016_114": "I must say, neither you nor Kirito were selling him short.\r\nI wasn't able to land a single hit.",
    "svo5016_115": "Well, it's plenty impressive that you took him on and came out unscathed.",
    "svo5016_116": "Assuming he wasn't holding back, that is.",
    "svo5016_117": "He was extremely serious, from what I could see. That is, he's the kind\r\nof person who's nothing but serious when he takes up his sword.",
    "svo5016_118": "Is that so? But even with such skill,\r\nthere is still something that sets him apart from you.",
    "svo5016_119": "Well, there's something that connects us to him.",
    "svo5016_120": "Kirito, especially.",
    "svo5016_121": "A connection?",
    "svo5016_122": "Either way, he's not someone who would up and betray us in the middle\r\nof a fight. I assure you. And I know Kirito would say the same.",
    "svo5016_123": "I understand.\r\nIf you both feel so strongly, then I have nothing else to say.",
    "svo5016_124": "There is someone in my life with whom I share a similar connection.",
    "svo5018_001": "No one's searched this area yet, right?",
    "svo5018_002": "Pretty sure no one has.",
    "svo5018_003": "...",
    "svo5018_004": "...",
    "svo5018_005": "I really hope Fuuka's all right.",
    "svo5018_006": "Definitely.",
    "svo5018_007": "...",
    "svo5018_008": "...",
    "svo5018_009": "Oh, Klein. You think this area might be a good place to look for Fuuka?",
    "svo5018_010": "Yeah, I'd say so.",
    "svo5018_011": "What do you think, Eiji?",
    "svo5018_012": "Hmm, tough to say.",
    "svo5018_013": "Heck of a half-assed answer there.",
    "svo5018_014": "It's more honest to say you're not sure than to talk out of your ass.",
    "svo5018_015": "Honest?!\r\nNow, there's a word I wouldn't expect to come out of your mouth.",
    "svo5018_016": "Klein, really?",
    "svo5018_017": "Kiridude, are you just totally cool with this guy now?",
    "svo5018_018": "You can't tell me you already forgot what he did.",
    "svo5018_019": "Course not. I just don't think now's the time for that.",
    "svo5018_020": "Klein, you're not—\r\nYou're not still salty that he broke your arm, are you?",
    "svo5018_021": "I'm only—",
    "svo5018_022": "If breaking my arm will make you feel better,\r\nI won't mind if you do.",
    "svo5018_023": "Also, I'm not expecting any of you to treat me like a friend.",
    "svo5018_024": "You—",
    "svo5018_025": "Oh, right. Breaking it in VR would only cause pain.",
    "svo5018_026": "If you wanna take revenge IRL, feel free.",
    "svo5018_027": "That's not what I'm talking about!\r\nWhat I'm tryin' to say is, well—!",
    "svo5018_028": "Eiji. Klein didn't mean it like that.",
    "svo5018_029": "For one thing, he's not mad 'cause of the arm thing. Right?",
    "svo5018_030": "Yeah. Exactly.",
    "svo5018_031": "I'm sorry. That was uncalled for.",
    "svo5018_032": "I shouldn't have said anything so inflammatory.\r\nI apologize.",
    "svo5018_033": "Listen, guys. While we're here—Hmm?",
    "svo5018_034": "Kirito.",
    "svo5018_035": "Yep.",
    "svo5018_036": "Enemy attack! Get ready, guys!",
    "svo5018_037": "Okay. Looks like we cleaned up without much hassle.",
    "svo5018_038": "Those were some sick combos back there.",
    "svo5018_039": "Yeah. Especially Klein coming in with some serious support.\r\nSaved us from a lot of damage.",
    "svo5018_040": "Wouldn't you agree, Eiji?",
    "svo5018_041": "Yes.",
    "svo5018_042": "Klein.",
    "svo5018_043": "What?",
    "svo5018_044": "You took out the enemies that were gunning for me back there, didn't you?",
    "svo5018_045": "You did me a solid, so... Thanks.",
    "svo5018_046": "...\r\nNot like I did that for your sake.",
    "svo5018_047": "Klein, you're just as pigheaded. You know that?",
    "svo5018_048": "I get how you feel, man.\r\nBut you'll never get your point across by being obstinate.",
    "svo5018_049": "Explain the situation. Clearly.",
    "svo5018_050": "...",
    "svo5018_051": "Yeah, Klein. Do it for me, too.",
    "svo5018_052": "I'm not asking you to be all buddy-buddy.\r\nI just don't want both of you to stay stuck in a misunderstanding.",
    "svo5018_053": "Fine. Damn it, Kirito, this ain't worth begging me for.",
    "svo5018_054": "I've—No, all of us at Fuurinkazan have a score to settle with you.",
    "svo5018_055": "Fuurinkazan. That's the guild you were in.",
    "svo5018_056": "The guild I assaulted.",
    "svo5018_057": "That it is.\r\nI wasn't the only one you injured during that incident.",
    "svo5018_058": "I don't give a crap how much I get beat up or if my arm's broken.",
    "svo5018_059": "But when my close friends get wrecked...\r\nNow, that's something I can't let go of easily.",
    "svo5018_060": "Right.",
    "svo5018_061": "Back me up here, Kiridude.\r\nYou get where I'm coming from, right?",
    "svo5018_062": "I do. All too well.",
    "svo5018_063": "But, Klein, didn't your friends withdraw their charges over the thing with Eiji?",
    "svo5018_064": "I thought the members of Fuurinkazan, including you, had long forgiven him.",
    "svo5018_065": "We never pressed charges 'cause he'd been punished enough.\r\nWould've been overkill to involve the police anymore.",
    "svo5018_066": "Still, that doesn't erase the fact that he hurt my friends.",
    "svo5018_067": "So, you're not trying to punish me, but you can't simply trust me.\r\nIs that it?",
    "svo5018_068": "Yeah.\r\nAnd allies you can't trust can be worse than enemies if you're not careful.",
    "svo5018_069": "And you, Kiridude!\r\nWe gotta be extra paranoid when a kind soul like you is leading the pack.",
    "svo5018_070": "Uh, kind soul?",
    "svo5018_071": "You're absolutely right.",
    "svo5018_072": "Allies you can't trust do nothing but create teamwork issues.",
    "svo5018_073": "Yup. It's nerve-racking enough having allies you don't trust,\r\nnever mind fighting alongside them.",
    "svo5018_074": "I agree.",
    "svo5018_075": "That's why I...\r\nConsidering what lies ahead, I'll make sure to stay away from you all.",
    "svo5018_076": "Eiji, that's not—",
    "svo5018_077": "I don't want to heap any more trouble or burdens on you.\r\nThis is the best course of action.",
    "svo5018_078": "But please do one thing for me. Take care of Yuna.",
    "svo5018_079": "Whoa, Eiji. Hold on there!",
    "svo5018_080": "Eiji!",
    "svo5018_081": "Hey, now, that's not where I was going with that!",
    "svo5018_082": "Wait! Wait! I'm sorry! Eiji, wait! Freakin' wait, will ya?!",
    "svo5018_083": "What is it?",
    "svo5018_084": "Agh, you know. I lost my cool, too. My bad.",
    "svo5018_085": "It's true I don't trust you as far as I can throw you.\r\nBut you're still an asset to the team.",
    "svo5018_086": "Am I?\r\nThere's a ton of people out there with skills like mine.",
    "svo5018_087": "Skills enough to beat the crap out of us self-proclaimed Clearers.\r\nThat's pretty dang good, don't you think?",
    "svo5018_088": "But that was in Ordinal Scale—That was AR.\r\nThis is VR. It's not the same.",
    "svo5018_089": "Don't say that. Take the compliment, man!",
    "svo5018_090": "You're a dang fine swordsman just from what I've seen in battle so far.",
    "svo5018_091": "I guess?",
    "svo5018_092": "Like I was sayin', my allies are super important to me.\r\nThey're irreplaceable.",
    "svo5018_093": "I'm always tryin' to keep 'em safe.",
    "svo5018_094": "Especially in tough times like these.\r\nI'll take all the help I can get.",
    "svo5018_095": "...",
    "svo5018_096": "So, like... You know!",
    "svo5018_097": "What I'm sayin' is we need you right now!",
    "svo5018_098": "...",
    "svo5018_099": "Okay. I'll help if you'll have me.",
    "svo5018_100": "B-But don't get me wrong!",
    "svo5018_101": "Guys like you are bound to get up to something if left to your own devices!",
    "svo5018_102": "Don't forget I'll be watchin' you at all times,\r\nso you better stay on the straight and narrow!",
    "svo5018_103": "Duly noted.",
    "svo5018_104": "Thanks, Klein.\r\nI appreciate you being on top of things.",
    "svo5018_105": "Oh, no you don't, Kirito.\r\nDon't you act like this has nothing to do with you.",
    "svo5018_106": "Huh?",
    "svo5018_107": "It's because you're so trusting that I'm stuck worrying over this and that.",
    "svo5018_108": "I'm inclined to agree.\r\nYou're way too much of a bleeding heart.",
    "svo5018_109": "What?",
    "svo5018_110": "You've literally got Heathcliff and Death Gun working together.\r\nWhat else can you call this situation but good-natured?",
    "svo5018_111": "Hey, come on.\r\nI consider them assets in our fight, like you said earlier.",
    "svo5018_112": "Sorry, what?! This is what I mean, Kiridude!\r\nYou are a dyed in the wool bleeding heart!",
    "svo5018_113": "Who knows what those two are capable of if left alone?!\r\nWe've got no choice but to keep tabs on them!",
    "svo5018_114": "Heh. It's true.",
    "svo5018_115": "That's why you gotta help us out, Eiji.",
    "svo5018_116": "'Cause man, those two are way more trouble than you.\r\nNo contest!",
    "svo5018_117": "Got it. If there's any way I can help, I'll do it.",
    "svo5018_118": "If that's all right with all of you.",
    "svo5018_119": "Yeah, man!",
    "svo5018_120": "Am I really that trusting?",
    "svo5018_121": "Are you honestly lacking that much self-awareness?",
    "svo5018_122": "Ask anyone, dude.",
    "svo5018_123": "What he said.",
    "svo5018_124": "Huh. Maybe I am.",
    "svo5020_001": "...",
    "svo5020_002": "...",
    "svo5020_003": "Um, hey.",
    "svo5020_004": "Huh? What is it?",
    "svo5020_005": "Your equipment's gotten a whole lot of use, hasn't it?",
    "svo5020_006": "There's some wear and tear, but that's what happens with use.\r\nI'm not too pressed about how it looks.",
    "svo5020_007": "No, see, what I'm trying to get at is it's on the verge of breaking!",
    "svo5020_008": "It is? How can you tell?",
    "svo5020_009": "I'm a blacksmith. Didn't you know?\r\nYou should be able to figure out at least that much by looking at me.",
    "svo5020_010": "Seriously, how have you let it get like that?\r\nYou gotta give it proper maintenance.",
    "svo5020_011": "I don't have the skills to do that.\r\nI'll try not to get hit from now on.",
    "svo5020_012": "*sigh*",
    "svo5020_013": "Not get hit? So, you're just going to dodge every attack?\r\nThat's just not realistic.",
    "svo5020_014": "Listen, take off your gear and let me see it.\r\nI'll do some repairs.",
    "svo5020_015": "I don't know.",
    "svo5020_016": "It's fine. We're safe here.",
    "svo5020_017": "That's not the problem. It's—\r\nAre you sure you should be doing maintenance on my equipment?",
    "svo5020_018": "I'm not doing this because I like you.\r\nI just can't bear to see fellow party members in gear that looks like that.",
    "svo5020_019": "I hear that. I'll gladly take you up on the offer, then.",
    "svo5020_020": "Hmm, that's about all I can do with what I have on hand.",
    "svo5020_021": "That's plenty. Thank you.",
    "svo5020_022": "Oh, this is far from plenty. It's not one good hit away from disintegrating,\r\nbut it's still half-baked at best.",
    "svo5020_023": "But you can't do any more than this, right?\r\nYou said so yourself.",
    "svo5020_024": "With the materials I have on hand, yes.\r\nSo, come on, gimme a hand.",
    "svo5020_025": "With?",
    "svo5020_026": "Finding the materials we need, duh.\r\nShould be able to get some good ore in this area.",
    "svo5020_027": "You wanna collect mats right now? You don't have to do all that for me.\r\nI really don't mind.",
    "svo5020_028": "But I do!",
    "svo5020_029": "Look over there. Go extract some rocks from that rock face.\r\nWe're gonna need more than just one or two.",
    "svo5020_030": "...",
    "svo5020_031": "We'll need sand, too. Grab a few bagfuls.\r\nYour gear'll come out prettier and sturdier if we sand it.",
    "svo5020_032": "...",
    "svo5020_033": "There's a monster over there. See it?\r\nWe need the pelts it drops.",
    "svo5020_034": "We're taking down monsters now?\r\nWe don't have to do all that.",
    "svo5020_035": "Like I said, I only repaired it to the point that it won't break down\r\nfrom a couple hits. Didn't you say you could dodge everything earlier?",
    "svo5020_036": "I'm not doubting the state of the gear.\r\nI'm just fine with you doing what you can and leaving it at that.",
    "svo5020_037": "And leave a job half finished? I won't stand for it.\r\nCome on, I'll fight, too. Let's do it!",
    "svo5020_038": "There. Now we have all the materials we need!\r\nThat went by quicker than I thought!",
    "svo5020_039": "Good stuff.",
    "svo5020_040": "Okay, now gimme your gear, so I can finish it up.",
    "svo5020_041": "Sure.",
    "svo5020_042": "Let's see.\r\nStart with a little of this, then some of this ore...",
    "svo5020_043": "So, why are you doing this?",
    "svo5020_044": "What do you mean?\r\nI'm getting things ready, so hang tight for a bit.",
    "svo5020_045": "Why are you doing all this for me?",
    "svo5020_046": "I told you. I couldn't ignore your equipment looking like it did.",
    "svo5020_047": "Even I know that's just an excuse.",
    "svo5020_048": "Oh, really?",
    "svo5020_049": "I caused trouble for you all. And even then—",
    "svo5020_050": "That's an awfully mild way of putting it.",
    "svo5020_051": "I'm really sorry for what I did.",
    "svo5020_052": "I'm just messing with you.\r\nI mean, you did cause us trouble, I won't argue that.",
    "svo5020_053": "Especially for Asuna and Silica.\r\nOh, and Klein. Kirito, too, I guess.",
    "svo5020_054": "...",
    "svo5020_055": "But I don't think anyone's hung up on it.",
    "svo5020_056": "So, there's no sense in me going on about this or that\r\nwhen I wasn't even directly affected.",
    "svo5020_057": "I see.",
    "svo5020_058": "Relax. I wouldn't even think of doing slipshod work on your gear.",
    "svo5020_059": "I swear by my title as master smith.",
    "svo5020_060": "I don't doubt it.\r\nYou don't strike me as the kind of person who'd do that.",
    "svo5020_061": "Not to mention, you wouldn't have gone through all the trouble\r\nto gather materials just to slack off now.",
    "svo5020_062": "True.",
    "svo5020_063": "You did a pretty nice job gathering materials yourself.\r\nWe couldn't have finished that fast otherwise.",
    "svo5020_064": "If you say so.\r\nCan't foresee getting that many chances to show off such a skill.",
    "svo5020_065": "You could get materials and do your own upkeep.\r\nYou can probably do the more basic maintenance yourself.",
    "svo5020_066": "I'll consider it.",
    "svo5020_067": "Done! Here, try it on.",
    "svo5020_068": "Thanks. Now I see. This is really top-notch work.",
    "svo5020_069": "What else would it be?\r\nProviding the highest quality is my bread and butter.",
    "svo5020_070": "Right. I can see why that guy trusts you.",
    "svo5020_071": "Well, you know.\r\nI wanna be the one to handle his equipment anyway.",
    "svo5020_072": "Thanks again, Lisbeth.",
    "svo5020_073": "Sure. Let me know if it gets worn down again.",
    "svo5020_074": "I'll take care of it when I have time.",
    "svo5020_075": "I'll hit you up if I get the chance. I'll look for a gap when you're not\r\nreceiving requests from that guy or whoever else.",
    "svo5020_076": "You might never get a turn if you hold back like that.\r\nAfter all, business is always booming at Lisbeth's Smith Shop!",
    "svo5021_001": "Oh.",
    "svo5021_002": "What's up, Yui?",
    "svo5021_003": "This forest...\r\nIt kinda looks like the one in which you, Mommy and I first met.",
    "svo5021_004": "Yeah, now that you mention it, I see it.\r\nThere might even be a lake or river nearby.",
    "svo5021_005": "First met?\r\nI thought you and Yui were parent and child.",
    "svo5021_006": "Oh, yes. Well—",
    "svo5021_007": "Yui is Asuna's and my daughter.",
    "svo5021_008": "She has been ever since the day we met on the 22nd layer of Aincrad.",
    "svo5021_009": "Daddy...",
    "svo5021_010": "Ah, I see.",
    "svo5021_011": "You and I first met at a forest, too, didn't we?\r\nMaybe you have some kind of connection to forests.",
    "svo5021_012": "Could be.",
    "svo5021_013": "I think you'll make a great dad.\r\nActually, you already are, no?",
    "svo5021_014": "He is! Daddy's the best daddy in the whole world!",
    "svo5021_015": "Erp.",
    "svo5021_016": "What's wrong, Daddy? Was that a bad thing to say?",
    "svo5021_017": "No, not at all.",
    "svo5021_018": "You're the best daughter in the world, too!",
    "svo5021_019": "Teeheehee! Thank you, Daddy!",
    "svo5021_020": "Haha, you get along so well as father and daughter.\r\nMan, Kirito, you're something else.",
    "svo5021_021": "How do you mean?",
    "svo5021_022": "We're not that different in age, but you're already an awesome dad.",
    "svo5021_023": "I don't know about awesome, but I'm sure you'll be a wonderful dad yourself\r\nwhen you have kids.",
    "svo5021_024": "You think so?",
    "svo5021_025": "I think so. You'd be such a sweet daddy.\r\nYou're always sweet to everyone.",
    "svo5021_026": "I bet you'd be so doting if you had a daughter like Yui.\r\nShe'd be the apple of your eye.",
    "svo5021_027": "The what of my what now?\r\nSince when do eyes have apples?",
    "svo5021_028": "No, it's like a metaphor.\r\nA figure of speech, you know.",
    "svo5021_029": "Oh, okay. As if being good at the Sacred Tongue wasn't enough,\r\nsometimes you have the most interesting turns of phrase.",
    "svo5021_030": "I would like to dote on a daughter of my own or whatever I happen to have.\r\nI'd also want her to have so much food she can eat till she's stuffed.",
    "svo5021_031": "I'm sure you'll have no problem doing that.",
    "svo5021_032": "...",
    "svo5021_033": "...?",
    "svo5021_034": "Hm? Everything okay, Eugeo?",
    "svo5021_035": "Oh, uh, yeah. Don't worry about it.",
    "svo5021_036": "Well then, should we get going? We got lost in conversation back there.",
    "svo5021_037": "Right.\r\nHey, Heathcliff, had enough of a break? Mind if we get back on track?",
    "svo5021_038": "Sure. I'm all set to go.",
    "svo5021_039": "Cool. Let's give it one more push!",
    "svo5021_040": "...",
    "svo5021_041": "We can talk if there's something you wish to discuss.",
    "svo5021_042": "Ah, sorry! Um, I just felt bad about earlier.",
    "svo5021_043": "What for?",
    "svo5021_044": "See, when Kirito, Yui and I were talking, I thought you, uh...",
    "svo5021_045": "Might have felt excluded from the conversation?",
    "svo5021_046": "Yes. Sorry about that.",
    "svo5021_047": "Think nothing of it.\r\nI don't do well in that kind of conversation to begin with.",
    "svo5021_048": "I'm relieved, actually, that you didn't force me into it.",
    "svo5021_049": "Oh. Huh.",
    "svo5021_050": "Is something bothering you?",
    "svo5021_051": "Just that you were watching us when we were talking, weren't you?\r\nThere was something gentle and peaceful to your glance.",
    "svo5021_052": "Heh. I see.",
    "svo5021_053": "Was I off the mark?",
    "svo5021_054": "No, no. Hmm. Let me put it this way.\r\nIt left a rather pleasant impression on me.",
    "svo5021_055": "It was quite charming seeing you converse.\r\nYou were speaking so amicably despite being\r\nfrom entirely different upbringings.",
    "svo5021_056": "It felt as though I was witnessing the continuation of a dream\r\nI had long ago.",
    "svo5021_057": "Oh? A dream?",
    "svo5021_058": "Yes.\r\nA distant dream I thought I would never see fulfilled.",
    "svo5021_059": "Heeey! Eugeo! Heathcliff! You're lagging behind!",
    "svo5021_060": "Is everything all right?",
    "svo5021_061": "Sorry, Kirito! We'll be right there!",
    "svo5021_062": "Let's go, Heathcliff.",
    "svo5021_063": "Yes. Forgive me for boring you with these old tales.",
    "svo5021_064": "Not at all. I feel like—\r\nLike I got to see a totally different side of you.",
    "svo5023_001": "Mommy, look! There's fruit growing over there!",
    "svo5023_002": "I'm pretty sure those are edible.",
    "svo5023_003": "Yeah. Looks like they are. And there's quite a few, too.\r\nMight as well pick some. What do you say?",
    "svo5023_004": "Let's!\r\nAnd we can use them to make Daddy and the others some food!",
    "svo5023_005": "Your cooking's so good, I'm sure everyone'll love it!",
    "svo5023_006": "I hope they do.\r\nAlthough, if we're going to be making food for everyone, this won't be enough.",
    "svo5023_007": "Wanna try finding ingredients around here?",
    "svo5023_008": "Yes! I'll help!",
    "svo5023_009": "Phew. Should we take a little break?",
    "svo5023_010": "We sure picked a ton, didn't we, Mommy?\r\nI was surprised to see so many growing in one spot.",
    "svo5023_011": "For sure. But with this many, they should yield enough for everyone.\r\nThey're tasty, too.",
    "svo5023_012": "What do you think? Did you like it?",
    "svo5023_013": "I did! It was sweet but also a little tart!\r\nSo yummy!",
    "svo5023_014": "Hee hee. Everyone's gonna be so happy. It's settled.\r\nThis will be our dessert today.",
    "svo5023_015": "Now, what to do next?\r\nWe had a stew yesterday, so maybe something else today.",
    "svo5023_016": "Mommy, you know so many dishes.\r\nDid you learn them so you could make them for Daddy?",
    "svo5023_017": "Hee hee! That might be why. He eats with such gusto.\r\nWatching him is somehow comforting.",
    "svo5023_018": "When Mommy cooks for me, I can eat a bunch, too.\r\nEven the first time I had it. That sandwich was really tasty.",
    "svo5023_019": "That's my most precious memory!",
    "svo5023_020": "Thank you.\r\nIt makes me so happy to hear you say that.",
    "svo5023_021": "Do you have any dishes that bring back nice memories?",
    "svo5023_022": "Let me see...",
    "svo5023_023": "I think I'd have to say rye bread with cream and ragout rabbit stew.",
    "svo5023_024": "Ooh! What kind of dishes are those?",
    "svo5023_025": "Rye bread with cream is the first thing Kirito ever gave me to eat.\r\nIt was right after we met.",
    "svo5023_026": "At the time, I was trapped in SAO and had lost all hope of living.\r\nI was just waiting to die.",
    "svo5023_027": "Mommy...",
    "svo5023_028": "Naturally, I couldn't have cared less about the taste of food,\r\nbut the rye bread with cream he gave me tasted amazing.",
    "svo5023_029": "I ate it in kind of a daze.\r\nBut I can never forget how it tasted in that moment.",
    "svo5023_030": "Bread that reminds you of Daddy...\r\nHow lovely. It sounds so yummy, too.",
    "svo5023_031": "I'd love to try it someday.",
    "svo5023_032": "Hee hee. I'm sure Kirito would make it for you if you asked.\r\nWanna ask him together?",
    "svo5023_033": "Yes! Thank you, Mommy!",
    "svo5023_034": "The ragout rabbit stew is another dish \r\nthat Kirito and I have fond memories of.",
    "svo5023_035": "Ragout rabbits are the monsters that drop S-class\r\ningredients, right?",
    "svo5023_036": "Yep. It was that very meat which Kirito brought to me and\r\nasked me to prepare for him.",
    "svo5023_037": "That sounds like the kind of thing Daddy would do.",
    "svo5023_038": "It does, doesn't it? But you know what?\r\nWe weren't even traveling together at the time.",
    "svo5023_039": "Really?!",
    "svo5023_040": "We were together around the time we first got into SAO.\r\nBut we went our separate ways after a while.\r\nAfterwards, we occasionally met and chatted. That's how it was.",
    "svo5023_041": "But after the rabbit ragout stew, we started\r\nspending a lot more time together.",
    "svo5023_042": "Ah, then it's like that dish made you get along again.",
    "svo5023_043": "Yeah. It was scrumptious, for sure,\r\nbut I think it was more so that I ate it with him.",
    "svo5023_044": "That's another dish I hope the three of us can have together someday.\r\nOnly thing is, unlike the rye bread with cream, there's no getting that meat.",
    "svo5023_045": "I say we go hunting together sometime and have ourselves a stew party!",
    "svo5023_046": "Oh, yes! That sounds so fun!",
    "svo5023_047": "I made a bunch of other things, too. I spent entirely too long\r\ntrying to perfect a condiment that tasted like soy sauce.",
    "svo5023_048": "But, as with everything else, maybe I managed to do it\r\nbecause of the people who loved eating it.",
    "svo5023_049": "I want to make you and Daddy something tasty.\r\nThat way we'll share more and more memorable dishes.",
    "svo5023_050": "Then, shall we do a little extra work?\r\nLet's make something really extravagant and give Kirito a huge surprise!",
    "svo5023_051": "Okay!",
    "svo5023_052": "Phew. What a haul! We got way more than just the fruit.",
    "svo5023_053": "We got fruit, mushrooms, and even meat!",
    "svo5023_054": "It was a nice stroke of luck that the monster that attacked us dropped some\r\nmeat! Should be able to make the main dish with it.",
    "svo5023_055": "So, Yui, how do you want to cook this?",
    "svo5023_056": "Hmm.",
    "svo5023_057": "Oh! Let's make sandwiches!",
    "svo5023_058": "Ooh, good idea. That's a memorable cuisine for you.",
    "svo5023_059": "Yup!",
    "svo5023_060": "I wonder if Daddy will say it's yummy. I'm not so good at cooking.\r\nNot like you, Mommy.",
    "svo5023_061": "Don't worry about it.\r\nKirito will absolutely say it's more delicious than any other sandwich ever.",
    "svo5023_062": "Are you sure?",
    "svo5023_063": "Most definitely.\r\nYou'd best believe I'm dying to have one of your sandwiches myself.",
    "svo5023_064": "Okay. Sandwiches it is, then.",
    "svo5023_065": "But Mommy, I don't want you to help me today.\r\nI'm gonna try my hardest to make them all by myself.",
    "svo5023_066": "Okay. I'll be looking forward to them. Now, let's go home.\r\nKirito's gonna be getting hungry.",
    "svo5023_067": "Let's! Just you wait, Daddy!",
    "svo5024_001": "*sigh*",
    "svo5024_002": "Something is definitely off.\r\nWhat is wrong with me?",
    "svo5024_003": "Heyo! What's a cute little lady looking so grim for?\r\nSpill the beans!",
    "svo5024_004": "Fuka! I know you're trying to be friendly but that's a little much!",
    "svo5024_005": "Hehe, you two are as chummy as ever.",
    "svo5024_006": "Hello, Sinon.\r\nSorry for dropping in on ya like that.",
    "svo5024_007": "Don't sweat it. I was just about to take a breather.",
    "svo5024_008": "So, what's this all about?\r\nYou looked all lost in your thoughts.",
    "svo5024_009": "To tell the truth, I was thinking about how my sniping's been a bit iffy lately.",
    "svo5024_010": "What?! You? Iffy?\r\nI thought you were kicking butt as usual last time we battled together.",
    "svo5024_011": "You were straight up nailing your targets at every distance!\r\nSure it's not all in your head?",
    "svo5024_012": "I'm glad it isn't bad enough for everyone to notice,\r\nbut I'm definitely off my game.",
    "svo5024_013": "A minor change is a big deal in sniping, you know?\r\nSo I can tell right away when something's off.",
    "svo5024_014": "Oh really? I wouldn't know, since I don't worry about that fancy stuff\r\nand just blow anything in my path to kingdom come.",
    "svo5024_015": "I think I get it.\r\nWell, not entirely, but somewhat.",
    "svo5024_016": "It's like, when you feel slower or just off your game.",
    "svo5024_017": "Huh, is that really what it's like?",
    "svo5024_018": "\"Off your game.\" Yes, I couldn't have put it better myself.",
    "svo5024_019": "Maybe I'm just more tired or stressed than I thought.",
    "svo5024_020": "Oh yeah, that adds up, considering you've been fighting at full throttle\r\nthese days. No wonder you're beat.",
    "svo5024_021": "All right then, that settles it!\r\nAs your GGO buddy, it's my duty to get you back to fighting strength!",
    "svo5024_022": "Yeah, you're right.\r\nI'd like you to get back in the game too, Sinon.",
    "svo5024_023": "Thanks a lot, you guys.",
    "svo5024_024": "Anyway, if you're offering to help, then tell me,\r\nwhat do you two do whenever you're off your game?",
    "svo5024_025": "Me? Hmm. Eat or sleep, I guess?",
    "svo5024_026": "Bond with my weapons!",
    "svo5024_027": "...I'm sorry, what?",
    "svo5024_028": "I get into kind of a funk when I don't feel love from my weapons.\r\nIt's times like those where it's important to give them what they're missing.",
    "svo5024_029": "Long story short, just stroke them and talk to them! Stuff like that!\r\nWorks like a charm.",
    "svo5024_030": "A-Are you sure?",
    "svo5024_031": "Yep! Showing weapons love makes them happy. You know what I mean, right?\r\nHow you can hear them talk to you when they're in a good mood and all?",
    "svo5024_032": "Uh, no, that's never happened to me.",
    "svo5024_033": "Wait, you can't? Seriously?",
    "svo5024_034": "Are you deaf?! I said no!",
    "svo5024_035": "Wh-What about you, Sinon?",
    "svo5024_036": "I... don't think so.",
    "svo5024_037": "I see.",
    "svo5024_038": "But all that aside, I believe the idea of developing a bond of trust\r\nwith your weapons to be a beautiful thing.",
    "svo5024_039": "You said it! These are your partners through life and death we're talking about here,\r\nso you gotta give 'em love!",
    "svo5024_040": "Speaking of which, do you have a name for that gun you always use, Sinon?",
    "svo5024_041": "Huh? No, not really.",
    "svo5024_042": "Hey, now that's just weapon cruelty!\r\nYou've gotta give it a name!",
    "svo5024_043": "Yeah! A name goes a long way!",
    "svo5024_044": "A name for my weapon? Hmm.",
    "svo5024_045": "Hey, I know! Since I've got experience in this field,\r\nwhy don't we do the honors of being your weapons' godparents and name 'em?!",
    "svo5024_046": "Okay? Okay. You're up, LLENN.",
    "svo5024_047": "How about \"Little Miss S\"?",
    "svo5024_048": "...That's pretty short and to the point.",
    "svo5024_049": "Eheheh, I got it from the \"s\" in \"sniping.\"",
    "svo5024_050": "Whoa, hey, how's that any different from Little Miss P?!",
    "svo5024_051": "What we need's a name that just screams \"cute and cuddly\"!\r\nSo how about...",
    "svo5024_052": "...Snitaro?!",
    "svo5024_053": "It's, uh, certainly unique.",
    "svo5024_054": "I know, right? I got it from the \"sni\" in \"sniping\" and modeled the last part\r\noff my own name? Isn't it just adorable?",
    "svo5024_055": "So Sinon, which do you prefer?\r\nLittle Miss S or Snitaro?",
    "svo5024_056": "Uh, let me think.",
    "svo5024_057": "It's hard to say—They're both equally charming.\r\nSo I can't decide just yet, but I really appreciate the help, you guys.",
    "svo5024_058": "No problem! Think it over and over until you finally make up your mind!",
    "svo5024_059": "Still, though, I'll remember to bond with my weapon,\r\nto treat it with love and care.",
    "svo5024_060": "Maybe I'll take a break to do some maintenance on it.",
    "svo5024_061": "Come to think of it, I probably haven't been giving Little Miss P the love\r\nshe deserves lately, either.",
    "svo5024_062": "Yeah, I haven't done any maintenance on Rightony and Leftania for a while.",
    "svo5024_063": "In that case, why don't we all take this opportunity to tune up our weapons\r\ntogether?",
    "svo5024_064": "Yeah, sounds great!",
    "svo5024_065": "I'm game!",
    "svo5026_001": "Good work, everyone. That was a fine battle.",
    "svo5026_002": "Yeah, you know it!\r\nMan, I really felt like I was whooping hides out there today!",
    "svo5026_003": "I'll say. It felt really easy.\r\nAnd great to be out there on the frontline, too.",
    "svo5026_004": "Yeah, you guys were movin' real smooth, all of ya.\r\nMaybe it's thanks to her backup?",
    "svo5026_005": "Well done, people.",
    "svo5026_006": "Well, lookie what we have here! Today's MVP!",
    "svo5026_007": "Sinon! We couldn't have fought as smoothly as we did without you.",
    "svo5026_008": "I really got the chills when I saw you blast those enemies away\r\nright in front of me!",
    "svo5026_009": "Th-Thank you.\r\nIt sounds like I was on top of my game this time.",
    "svo5026_010": "I'd heard stories from Kirito,\r\nbut you truly are a brilliant shot, Sinon.",
    "svo5026_011": "Yeah, she really lives up to the legend.\r\nGotta update my own info!",
    "svo5026_012": "Of course she does! This is the same Sniper Queen who made a name for herself\r\nin BoB—The Bullet of Bullets!",
    "svo5026_013": "Queen? Oh, stop it, Fukaziroh.\r\nYou give me far too much credit.",
    "svo5026_014": "Bull Head of Bull Heads? What's that?",
    "svo5026_015": "No silly, Bullet of Bullets. It's a popular tournament to determine\r\nthe strongest player in GGO, the game we play.",
    "svo5026_016": "The Squad Jams that Fukaziroh and I fight in all the time are team battles,\r\nbut you're totally on your own in BoB.",
    "svo5026_017": "Hence why your own personal skill matters!",
    "svo5026_018": "So basically, making a name for yourself there proves\r\nyou're the baddest of badasses!",
    "svo5026_019": "I see, so it's a huge competition—\r\nKind of like a sword fighting tournament, huh?",
    "svo5026_020": "You truly are impressive to have excelled in such a grand tournament, Sinon.",
    "svo5026_021": "Oh no, I still have a ways to go.",
    "svo5026_022": "Sounds to me like you've still got some work to do.",
    "svo5026_023": "Does that mean there's still something out there\r\nyou haven't managed to shoot down?",
    "svo5026_024": "Hmm. Let me think.",
    "svo5026_025": "Ooh! I know! The boy you love's heart!\r\nThat's gotta be it!",
    "svo5026_026": "Well, umm, m-maybe you're on to something.",
    "svo5026_027": "Wait, huh? Did I upset you?",
    "svo5026_028": "Can you blame her? That's not something you can actually shoot down...\r\nHow do you respond to something like that?",
    "svo5026_029": "Hehe, it's still juicy intel in my book.",
    "svo5026_030": "Well, what I wanna know is what Sinon can't physically take down!",
    "svo5026_031": "Oh, wait! Something really small and fast, maybe?",
    "svo5026_032": "Heheh, you mean just like yourself?",
    "svo5026_033": "Eheheh... I guess when you put it like that...",
    "svo5026_034": "For sure, there's been some really difficult targets... But nothing can run \r\nforever, right?",
    "svo5026_035": "So I just wait until they stop and take my shot.",
    "svo5026_036": "You make it sound so easy, but even a non-moving target is hard to hit, isn't it?!",
    "svo5026_037": "You have any idea how many still targets I've missed?!",
    "svo5026_038": "That sounds more like a you problem.",
    "svo5026_039": "Let off her. I'm sure that's just because Fukaziroh is so kind\r\nthat she doesn't wish to hurt anyone, deep down.",
    "svo5026_040": "Eugeo! You're gonna melt my heart!",
    "svo5026_041": "Uh, yeah, no, Fukaziroh's definitely more the \"shoot first,\r\nask questions later\" type.",
    "svo5026_042": "Anyway... All I'm saying is that if you wanna beat Sinon, you gotta take her\r\ndown before she gets you in her sights.",
    "svo5026_043": "Sure sounds like it! Kill or be killed is the basics of combat!",
    "svo5026_044": "So, how do you deal with an opponent who tries something like that, Sinon?",
    "svo5026_045": "I take them down before I have time to end up in that sort of pickle.\r\nNothing more, nothing less.",
    "svo5026_046": "Wow.",
    "svo5026_047": "Eeep.",
    "svo5026_048": "Dang.",
    "svo5026_049": "Interestin'.",
    "svo5026_050": "Y-You're awesome, Sinon!",
    "svo5026_051": "Y-You are way too cool, Sinon!",
    "svo5026_052": "Y-You're seriously cool, Sinon!",
    "svo5026_053": "Y-You're so freakin' cool, Sinon!",
    "svo5026_054": "Pl-Please, none of that.\r\nI wasn't trying to brag, really.",
    "svo5026_055": "C'mon, give yourself some credit!\r\nThat line gave me the chills!",
    "svo5026_056": "Indeed. Truly the words of a fierce warrior.",
    "svo5026_057": "Wouldn't wanna be on the other end of your gun, that's for sure.",
    "svo5026_058": "I'd better start brushing up on anti-sniping tactics.",
    "svo5026_059": "Y-You guys!",
    "svo5026_060": "Maybe I ended up getting too carried away.",
    "svo5027_001": "...",
    "svo5027_002": "Neige, you're worried about Fuuka, aren't you?",
    "svo5027_003": "I'm sure Fuuka must have her reasons.",
    "svo5027_004": "I know this'll sound weird coming from me since I was attacked directly,\r\nbut I think you should ask her why before you start shouting at her or anything.",
    "svo5027_005": "You feel the same, right, Neige?\r\nI mean, you were with her longer than anyone else.",
    "svo5027_006": "Yes. Fuuka and I used to converse over tea quite a lot.",
    "svo5027_007": "So I know her quite well, or at least, I thought I did.",
    "svo5027_008": "Now, I'm not so sure. I can't fathom why she would hurt others\r\nand get in their way.",
    "svo5027_009": "Nor why she disappeared, or why she didn't tell me anything.",
    "svo5027_010": "Don't worry! I'm sure it must have been something so serious\r\nthat she couldn't even tell her best friend!",
    "svo5027_011": "Maybe you're right. Or rather, I hope you are.\r\nStill, I'm scared.",
    "svo5027_012": "I keep wondering, did Fuuka ever see me as a friend?",
    "svo5027_013": "Because i-if it turns out I'm the only one who did, then I—",
    "svo5027_014": "You were the closest one to her there was,\r\nso I understand why this is killing you inside.",
    "svo5027_015": "But please, let us know if there's anything we can do for you.",
    "svo5027_016": "Same! I'll give you whatever hand you need!",
    "svo5027_017": "Also, please don't worry about it so much.\r\nWe still don't have the full story yet.",
    "svo5027_018": "Asuna, Yui, thank you both so much.",
    "svo5027_019": "...",
    "svo5027_020": "(I too know what it feels like to be lost at sea when your beliefs are shaken.)",
    "svo5027_021": "(I just wish there was something I could do to be of service to her.)",
    "svo5027_022": "Is something on your mind, Alice?\r\nYou have a most unsettled look on your face.",
    "svo5027_023": "Lady Cardinal.",
    "svo5027_024": "I was merely wondering if there was any way I could be of aid\r\nin lifting Neige's spirits.",
    "svo5027_025": "Hmm.",
    "svo5027_026": "Well, if it's aid you wish to lend,\r\neveryone is doing that by working to find Fuuka.",
    "svo5027_027": "Why not join them?",
    "svo5027_028": "That is the idea, yes. However—",
    "svo5027_029": "Heehee. You truly do possess a kindly soul, child.",
    "svo5027_030": "I have an idea, then.",
    "svo5027_031": "What would you say to hosting a tea party?",
    "svo5027_032": "What? Is this really the time for a tea party,\r\ngiven the circumstances?",
    "svo5027_033": "That's exactly WHY it's the perfect time.\r\nEveryone is on constant edge right now.",
    "svo5027_034": "Indeed, hence why we do not have the time to be holding a—",
    "svo5027_035": "When people are on edge, they lose sight of what truly matters.\r\nYou must not forget the importance of maintaining serenity.",
    "svo5027_036": "Anxiety only grows the more you bottle it up. So don't you think talking to\r\nfriends over a cup of tea would be a great way to put it at ease?",
    "svo5027_037": "Perhaps, you have a point.",
    "svo5027_038": "Doesn't sound like a bad idea, does it?",
    "svo5027_039": "And besides, it's not that hard to arrange, either.\r\nAll you need is tea and some cups.",
    "svo5027_040": "Hey, what're you guys doing?",
    "svo5027_041": "Oh, nothing.\r\nAlice was just telling me about how she wanted to hold a tea party.",
    "svo5027_042": "A tea party? This is rather sudden, don't you think?",
    "svo5027_043": "A tea party? I think that's a wonderful idea.\r\nI'd certainly love the chance to sit down and get to know you all.",
    "svo5027_044": "Yeah. I know we've got a lot weighing on our minds right now,\r\nbut some nice pastries and tea might just be the medicine we need.",
    "svo5027_045": "I think it's a great idea!\r\nTasty food and drink is perfect for putting people at ease!",
    "svo5027_046": "You know, when you guys put it like that, it doesn't sound so crazy after all.\r\nPeople really need someone to talk to after all this fighting and searching.",
    "svo5027_047": "Do you see now, Alice?\r\nNot such an outlandish plan, is it?",
    "svo5027_048": "Indeed, you make a fair point. Perhaps, it would be for the best,\r\nconsidering this show of enthusiasm all around.",
    "svo5027_049": "However, there still lies the issue of where we are supposed to acquire\r\nthe pastries and snacks we shall require.",
    "svo5027_050": "Oh, you can just leave all that to me!\r\nI'm sure I can whip up some great stuff!",
    "svo5027_051": "And since we're all here, we can go farming for all the ingredients now!",
    "svo5027_052": "Whew, that should do it.",
    "svo5027_053": "It is about time we regrouped with the others, Kirito.",
    "svo5027_054": "Yeah, we should have enough now.",
    "svo5027_055": "But hey, Alice?\r\nWhere'd all this stuff about having a tea party come from?",
    "svo5027_056": "It sparked from when I wondered what I could do after seeing how distraught\r\nNeige looked.",
    "svo5027_057": "Neige?",
    "svo5027_058": "Yes. I was hoping I could lift her spirits.",
    "svo5027_059": "You see, a part of me understands what she is going through.",
    "svo5027_060": "As you surely remember, I too was once struck with fright and uncertainty when\r\nmy convictions were turned on their heads.",
    "svo5027_061": "While I understand our situations aren't entirely identical,\r\nI still can imagine her pain must be similar to mine in those bygone days.",
    "svo5027_062": "And if my intuition holds true,\r\nthen the anxiety she is carrying is far too great for her to bear alone.",
    "svo5027_063": "Alice...",
    "svo5027_064": "Perhaps... Perhaps seeing how attached she is to Fuuka reminds me of\r\nmy sister Selka.",
    "svo5027_065": "For as a sister, I constantly pray that Selka's life be one of bliss\r\nand good fortune.",
    "svo5027_066": "I must admit, even I don't think that sounds like me.\r\nBut perhaps I truly am speaking from the heart.",
    "svo5027_067": "Well, whatever your reasons, one thing's for sure...\r\nYou really do want to help Neige.",
    "svo5027_068": "I sure hope this tea party is just what she needs to cheer up.",
    "svo5027_069": "Indeed. Nothing would make me happier than to have been of service\r\nin raising her spirits.",
    "svo5027_070": "We rounded up tons of pastry ingredients!",
    "svo5027_071": "Yeah! All of us really broke a sweat out there!",
    "svo5027_072": "Kirito, Alice, how did it go on your end?",
    "svo5027_073": "Pretty sure we brought back enough to make seconds if we wanted.",
    "svo5027_074": "Splendid work, all of you.",
    "svo5027_075": "Thank you, all so much.\r\nI believe we now will not have to want for anything during the tea party.",
    "svo5027_076": "Yeah! With all the pastries and snacks we can make,\r\nthis tea party's going to be a blast, I'm sure of it!",
    "svo5027_077": "But no matter what, we need to crank out something so fun\r\nthat Neige will just have to smile.",
    "svo5027_078": "You knew this was all for her, Asuna?",
    "svo5027_079": "More like I had a hunch, I guess.\r\nReally, it's mostly because I wanted to do something for Neige too.",
    "svo5027_080": "So when you beat me to the punch and suggested the tea party,\r\nI had a feeling the two of us were on the same page.",
    "svo5027_081": "Your consideration for others truly knows no peer, I swear.",
    "svo5027_082": "I'm concerned for Neige, too, Alice.\r\nThat's why I'm all for this tea party.",
    "svo5027_083": "Please, let me know if there is anything else I can do to be of assistance.",
    "svo5027_084": "Thank you, Eugeo.",
    "svo5027_085": "Man, I can't wait to see what snacks we have at the tea party.",
    "svo5027_086": "Just so that you are aware, Kirito, you are only sanctioned to eat that\r\nwhich I give express permission for.",
    "svo5027_087": "What?! But why?!",
    "svo5027_088": "Because you seem the type who shall render the whole table barren before others\r\nget the chance—If left unfettered, that is.",
    "svo5027_089": "Ahaha! You've got him there.",
    "svo5027_090": "I agree with Alice, that sounds like it would be for the best.\r\nEspecially since some of us prefer to take their time eating.",
    "svo5027_091": "Take your eye off of Kirito, and he may very well turn this tea party\r\ninto a banquet.",
    "svo5027_092": "That's 'cause Daddy's such a glutton!",
    "svo5027_093": "Why is everyone getting on my case?",
    "svo5027_094": "Many thanks to each and every one of you.\r\nI would like to begin prep for the tea party posthaste.",
    "svo5027_095": "Seeing all this excitement before the main part of the tea party\r\nmakes me truly glad I suggested it.",
    "svo5027_096": "It would appear we have been roped into setting up as well.\r\nI shall be expecting a grand tea party.",
    "svo5027_097": "It won't disappoint, I promise!",
    "svo5028_001": "We've already put so much effort into this tea party.\r\nI have to ensure we are not lacking anything.",
    "svo5028_002": "Hmm. We appear to be set on plates and cups.\r\nWhat else...",
    "svo5028_003": "Ugh! See, this is why no one likes you!",
    "svo5028_004": "Wench! You dare address a king in such a manner?!",
    "svo5028_005": "Whoa, hey, c'mon guys, chill!",
    "svo5028_006": "You really suck, you know that?! Who do you think you are, forcing me\r\nto deal with all those monsters?! And you call yourself the Fairy King?!",
    "svo5028_007": "Hmph, just how feeble is your mind?\r\nCan it not comprehend that dealing with such lowlifes is far beneath my station?",
    "svo5028_008": "And so you foist them all on me?! Jerk!",
    "svo5028_009": "Seriously, c'mon, let's just wipe 'em out ourselves.\r\nWe'll be done in a flash! Okay?",
    "svo5028_010": "You're not list... Oh, Alice!",
    "svo5028_011": "Greetings.\r\nReturning from your expedition, I take it?",
    "svo5028_012": "Yep, we were just heading back now. What about you?\r\nWhatcha doing out here?",
    "svo5028_013": "Preparing for a tea party.",
    "svo5028_014": "A tea party? What a quaint idea in such turbulent times!\r\nWhat's next, a picnic?",
    "svo5028_015": "This chaos is precisely what makes it the perfect time.\r\nAll this constant tension will wear us down.",
    "svo5028_016": "So I was hoping that I could aid in that by holding a tea party\r\nto set everyone at ease.",
    "svo5028_017": "Alice, that's a great idea! I'm game!",
    "svo5028_018": "Oh dang, first she's super strong and now she's super considerate?\r\nAre you just like the perfect woman or something, Alice?!",
    "svo5028_019": "You said it. Alice really does care a lot for others.\r\nUnlike a certain someone here.",
    "svo5028_020": "Hmph. Your barbs mean nothing.",
    "svo5028_021": "Anyway, is there anything I can do to help, Alice?",
    "svo5028_022": "Ooh, me too, me too!\r\nIf you need something, I'm your girl!",
    "svo5028_023": "Well, since you so kindly offered your services, I shall take you up on that.\r\nTruth be told, we are lacking the key ingredient—Tea leaves.",
    "svo5028_024": "That is not to say we don't have any,\r\nbut I am concerned they will not be enough for such a large group.",
    "svo5028_025": "Tea leaves, huh? Dunno if I can help you with something so chic.\r\nMy skills are mostly in blowing stuff up.",
    "svo5028_026": "Mmm, I dunno much about them either.",
    "svo5028_027": "Hey, you wouldn't happen to know, would you Oberon?\r\nDon't you like fancy stuff like that for your preening?",
    "svo5028_028": "Be grateful I have deigned to ignore that last part.",
    "svo5028_029": "But yes, I do know a thing or two about tea leaves.",
    "svo5028_030": "Seriously?! What about where we can find 'em?!",
    "svo5028_031": "But of course.",
    "svo5028_032": "In that case, would you tell us?",
    "svo5028_033": "Out of the question.",
    "svo5028_034": "What the hell?!\r\nJust how far up your own butt do you keep your head, anyway?!",
    "svo5028_035": "That is exactly my question to all of you.\r\nWhy need a ruler such as myself help such lowlifes as yourselves?",
    "svo5028_036": "Lowlifes?\r\nI see, so that is how you view my friends, is it?",
    "svo5028_037": "It would appear necessary to have you demonstrate that you possess the finesse\r\nto back up your massive ego.",
    "svo5028_038": "Not at all!\r\nI'll just whack him on the head with my hammer to fix him good!",
    "svo5028_039": "H-Hold it!\r\nSee, this predisposition to violence is precisely why I hate peasants!",
    "svo5028_040": "Hey, guys, come on, cool off! I just had an idea!",
    "svo5028_041": "Why don't we have Oberon show off this royal power of his\r\nthat he's always bragging about?",
    "svo5028_042": "For him to talk himself up so much surely means that he must be super powerful.\r\nAin't that right?",
    "svo5028_043": "Hmph. Do you seriously believe I'll rise to such a blatant provocation?",
    "svo5028_044": "Wait, you're not gonna do it? You're such a miser.",
    "svo5028_045": "Well, I suppose it is just too difficult for you, then.\r\nI've certainly never witnessed this skill of yours that you pride yourself in.",
    "svo5028_046": "I beg your pardon?",
    "svo5028_047": "Yeah, you said it, Alice. He had me fight all the monsters we came across just\r\nbefore you found us. Maybe he's not as great as he makes himself out to be.",
    "svo5028_048": "Y-You curs!\r\nYou think you can just run your mouths however you please?!",
    "svo5028_049": "Fine, so be it! You fools shall bear witness to my strength!\r\nI'll wipe those smug looks off your faces!",
    "svo5028_050": "Oh, does that mean you'll help us gather the tea leaves?",
    "svo5028_051": "Hmph! I can have everything ready for a measly little tea party in a flash!\r\nJust you watch!",
    "svo5028_052": "Woohoo!\r\nWe get to see Oberon actually shine for once!",
    "svo5028_053": "You have my gratitude.\r\nI suppose, I can expect you to get the job done.",
    "svo5028_054": "Follow me, peons! I shall not wait for any of you!",
    "svo5028_055": "Awesome! We got tea leaves!",
    "svo5028_056": "Indeed. And such fine ones, at that.\r\nThese will be perfect for the tea party. Thank you so much.",
    "svo5028_057": "Whaddya know, you actually pulled your weight out there, Oberon!",
    "svo5028_058": "H-Hmph. That was nothing.",
    "svo5028_059": "Oh? Looking kinda beat there, Oberon.",
    "svo5028_060": "M-Me, tired over a tiny skirmish?! Of course not!\r\nHow dare you!",
    "svo5028_061": "Yeah, he actually fought with some style and grace!\r\nCan't believe I'm saying this, but he was cool out there!",
    "svo5028_062": "I know, he was such a badass out there!\r\nHe was exactly what a king SHOULD be like!",
    "svo5028_063": "I must apologize for my comments about your inflated ego.",
    "svo5028_064": "It would seem you truly do have the bite to match your bark.\r\nYour assistance was greatly appreciated.",
    "svo5028_065": "Hmph. So now you all finally see how strong I truly am.",
    "svo5028_066": "You're telling me! You were like a one-man army!",
    "svo5028_067": "Now that that's settled, let's go farm some more!",
    "svo5028_068": "Man, now I just wanna invite a hundred people to this tea party\r\nwhile we're at it!",
    "svo5028_069": "Heheh, that would be impossible.\r\nRegardless, I appreciate the sentiment.",
    "svo5028_070": "W-Wait! You mean we aren't done?",
    "svo5028_071": "Indeed. There is still much we need.",
    "svo5028_072": "C'mon, Oberon! Quit panting like you just ran in the Olympics!\r\nWe've got ground to cover!",
    "svo5028_073": "Let's do it! I wanna see Oberon shine again!",
    "svo5028_074": "Surely you jest! I'm leav—",
    "svo5028_075": "Let's hit the road!",
    "svo5028_076": "Yay!",
    "svo5028_077": "Indeed, let us continue our endeavors.",
    "svo5028_078": "Listen to me, you mongrels!",
    "svo5028_079": "Grrr! I'm never helping again!",
    "svo5029_001": "Now we have the snacks, pastries, and tea leaves.",
    "svo5029_002": "While this is enough to hold a tea party,\r\nI still feel like there's room for improvement.",
    "svo5029_003": "Hmm.",
    "svo5029_004": "Alice!",
    "svo5029_005": "Hello there, Alice.",
    "svo5029_006": "Sinon, Leafa, good afternoon.\r\nIs something the matter?",
    "svo5029_007": "Nah. Kirito just told us about the tea party,\r\nso we came to see how that was going.",
    "svo5029_008": "So what do you think? Is it looking good?",
    "svo5029_009": "Yes, it's proceeding swimmingly.\r\nI believe we shall be able to hold the party as we currently stand.",
    "svo5029_010": "Oh, is that right?\r\nI guess we're too late to help out, then.",
    "svo5029_011": "Well, actually, I was just thinking about sprucing it up a little more.",
    "svo5029_012": "Oh, what'd you have in mind?",
    "svo5029_013": "Well, Oberon told me that herbs accentuate the flavor of tea\r\nwhen he helped me earlier.",
    "svo5029_014": "So you were thinking of blending tea with herbs?",
    "svo5029_015": "I suppose he does look the type who'd know his stuff about that.",
    "svo5029_016": "Then, let's go and find us some herbs now!",
    "svo5029_017": "That would be much appreciated.\r\nBut have you the time?",
    "svo5029_018": "Oh, this won't be any trouble at all.",
    "svo5029_019": "All righty then, let's get down to business!",
    "svo5029_020": "Thank you both. Please, exercise caution.",
    "svo5029_021": "We should be able to acquire herbs around here.",
    "svo5029_022": "Look over there, Sinon!",
    "svo5029_023": "Isn't that Eiji? Oh no, he's surrounded!",
    "svo5029_024": "Let's back him up!",
    "svo5029_025": "Right!",
    "svo5029_026": "Whew. All targets eliminated.",
    "svo5029_027": "You okay, Eiji? You're not hurt, are you?",
    "svo5029_028": "No, I'm fine. Thank you for the assist.",
    "svo5029_029": "I wasn't sure how I was going to get out of that when there turned out to be\r\nmore than expected.",
    "svo5029_030": "Why was it that all those monsters were surrounding you anyhow?",
    "svo5029_031": "Well, I haven't been at the top of my game recently,\r\nso I was trying to get some training in to fix that.",
    "svo5029_032": "I thought the more I fought, the quicker I'd get back into the swing of things.",
    "svo5029_033": "I see, so that's when—",
    "svo5029_034": "That explains why you were dealing with so many.",
    "svo5029_035": "I totally get what you mean, though.\r\nI do a thousand practice swings whenever I'm feeling off my game.",
    "svo5029_036": "That was essentially what I was after.\r\nBut it seems I was too impatient and ended up aggroing too many.",
    "svo5029_037": "Anyway, what are you two doing out here?",
    "svo5029_038": "Alice is planning a tea party for Neige.",
    "svo5029_039": "We're here to find some herbs for that.",
    "svo5029_040": "Oh? Mind if I help, then?",
    "svo5029_041": "Huh? But what about your training?",
    "svo5029_042": "This isn't a good time for that.\r\nNot when my impatience is getting the better of me like that.",
    "svo5029_043": "Besides, I owe you both.",
    "svo5029_044": "Good idea!\r\nGetting your mind off things is sure to help you out!",
    "svo5029_045": "They always say the more, the merrier.\r\nSo I'd like to take you up on that offer.",
    "svo5029_046": "So, uh, hey, Eiji, you know, I've been thinking...",
    "svo5029_047": "Hmm? What?",
    "svo5029_048": "Well, maybe you're off your game because you're tired?",
    "svo5029_049": "I don't think so? I don't feel all that tired, anyway.",
    "svo5029_050": "That's only because you're too focused to notice.",
    "svo5029_051": "I'm the same way, so I know what that's like.",
    "svo5029_053": "...You really think so?",
    "svo5029_054": "It's only natural you'd get tired in a new environment\r\nwith one unexpected thing happening after the next.",
    "svo5029_055": "So you say, but I'd like to think I've been getting enough rest.\r\nI'm not sure what else I can do.",
    "svo5029_056": "Why not have some herbal tea yourself?",
    "svo5029_057": "Herbs don't just smell good,\r\nthey ease the mind and do wonders for exhaustion.",
    "svo5029_058": "Huh, I didn't know that.\r\nI just thought they made food taste better.",
    "svo5029_059": "She's right.\r\nAnd what tea does for you depends on the blend.",
    "svo5029_060": "There are those that treat upset stomachs, others that warm you up,\r\nand some that calm you down or cheer you up.",
    "svo5029_061": "I never realized a simple change in blend could have such drastic results.",
    "svo5029_062": "In that case, maybe I should try some if all it takes is tea to help me out.",
    "svo5029_063": "Just a few sips and you'll be right as rain.",
    "svo5029_064": "Hey, that gives me an idea! Why don't we use a special blend for the tea party.\r\nThat'll cheer Neige right up, don't you think?",
    "svo5029_065": "If we blend all kinds of stuff—not just herbs—\r\nwe can create an ultra tea that'll snap Neige right out of her funk!",
    "svo5029_066": "Much as I'm for the idea, I have to ask, what are we supposed to put in the tea?",
    "svo5029_067": "Got any ideas, Sinon?\r\nAnything good for the body and soul you can think of?",
    "svo5029_068": "Hmm.",
    "svo5029_069": "Well, sniping requires focus, right?\r\nSo I looked into what sort of everyday things could help with that.",
    "svo5029_070": "I see, I see.",
    "svo5029_071": "And when I did, I found out that sardines help.",
    "svo5029_072": "Uh, even I can tell sardines and tea go about as well together\r\nas ketchup on a donut.",
    "svo5029_073": "G-Good point.",
    "svo5029_074": "What about you, Leafa?\r\nSurely you're often worn out from constant kendo sparring.",
    "svo5029_075": "Ah, well, I have energy drinks for times like those.",
    "svo5029_076": "Maybe it's just a placebo or something, but drinking them really fires me up\r\nand gives me the will to keep going.",
    "svo5029_077": "Huh, so energy drinks actually do work?\r\nWhat do they put in them?",
    "svo5029_078": "Eh, stuff like extract of ginseng and chili pepper capsaicin.",
    "svo5029_079": "So whaddya say we throw that in the tea?\r\nIt'll give Neige the burst of energy she needs!",
    "svo5029_080": "Wouldn't it be easier to just have an energy drink in that case?",
    "svo5029_081": "Yeah, good point.",
    "svo5029_082": "W-Well what about you, Eiji? Any ideas?",
    "svo5029_083": "Hmm. Honestly, this isn't really my field of expertise.",
    "svo5029_084": "Surely you must have eaten or drank something that perked you up.",
    "svo5029_085": "Uh, hard candy, maybe?",
    "svo5029_086": "Huh? What, you mean like a cough drop?",
    "svo5029_087": "No, I don't mean anything healthy, per se.\r\nSee, Yuna gave me candy this one time I was down in the dumps.",
    "svo5029_088": "Eating that did wonders in perking me up.",
    "svo5029_089": "I don't think that was the candy's doing.",
    "svo5029_090": "Yeah. The candy itself was just plain old candy.\r\nNothing special or anything.",
    "svo5029_091": "It was probably Yuna's encouragement that perked me up.",
    "svo5029_092": "Wait, in hindsight, this isn't much help, is it?\r\nSorry about that.",
    "svo5029_093": "Oh no, it was a great help.",
    "svo5029_094": "She's right. You've taught us that it's not just the ingredients themselves\r\nthat are important, it's the feelings behind them.",
    "svo5029_095": "It's, uh, kinda embarrassing that's the conclusion you reached\r\nfrom my own experience.",
    "svo5029_096": "Still, the short of it is that it's the thoughts and feelings that\r\ngo into the herbs and tea that Alice uses that'll help Neige best.",
    "svo5029_097": "Yeah. Besides, this is VR, so herbs and tea might not have the health benefits\r\nthey do in The Real World.",
    "svo5029_098": "But that doesn't change that the feeling of wanting to cheer Neige up\r\nis the best medicine there is, whether IRL or in VR.",
    "svo5029_099": "Feelings... Yes, you're right.\r\nThose remain the same in both worlds.",
    "svo5029_100": "You're telling me! And they always say that sickness and health\r\nstart with the mind, so feelings are super important!",
    "svo5029_101": "Now with that settled, let's go round up some herbs for Alice and Neige!",
    "svo5029_102": "By the way, uh, what exactly do herbs look like?\r\nHow will I know what it is when I see one?",
    "svo5029_103": "Glad you asked! Take a look at this data!",
    "svo5029_104": "Heehee, let's bring back a whole bunch of herbs.",
    "svo5030_001": "Everything's all set for the tea party now.",
    "svo5030_002": "But who to invite first? Logic dictates it should be Neige, yes?",
    "svo5030_003": "In that case, I'd better go find her.",
    "svo5030_004": "She's not here.",
    "svo5030_005": "Odd. I don't see Neige anywhere.",
    "svo5030_006": "Heya, Alice!",
    "svo5030_007": "Well hey, if it isn't Alice. What's up?",
    "svo5030_008": "Just lemme know if ya need anythin', okay?\r\nI'll give ya a discount for my services.",
    "svo5030_009": "Hey, I thought you were an information broker, not a con artist.",
    "svo5030_010": "Hehe, just kidding.",
    "svo5030_011": "But seriously, what's up?",
    "svo5030_012": "Well, I cannot find Neige anywhere.",
    "svo5030_013": "Neige?\r\nYeah, now that you mention it, I don't think I've seen her.",
    "svo5030_014": "Me neither.",
    "svo5030_015": "Same for the two of us, I take it?",
    "svo5030_016": "Yeah.",
    "svo5030_017": "I'm a little worried.\r\nGoing missing when you're as bummed as her is rarely a good sign.",
    "svo5030_018": "Indeed. I fear something may have happened to her.",
    "svo5030_019": "Then let's all go look for her!",
    "svo5030_020": "She's right! No need to worry, Alice!\r\nI'm sure we'll find her in no time!",
    "svo5030_021": "We've got a pretty nicely-sized search party, too.",
    "svo5030_022": "Not to mention you've got an information broker on your side.\r\nI've got eyes and ears everywhere, so findin' her'll be a piece of cake!",
    "svo5030_023": "Thank you all.",
    "svo5030_024": "In that case, let us commence our search posthaste.",
    "svo5030_025": "Neige!",
    "svo5030_026": "Where are you, Neige?",
    "svo5030_027": "Huh? Hey, ain't that...",
    "svo5030_028": "N-Neige!",
    "svo5030_029": "N-Neige, you hear me?!",
    "svo5030_030": "What are you doing here?",
    "svo5030_031": "I can't let them see me like this.",
    "svo5030_032": "Monsters?!",
    "svo5030_033": "Look out! Enemies incoming!",
    "svo5030_034": "Huh?! Wh-Whoa!",
    "svo5030_035": "Prepare for battle!",
    "svo5030_036": "You got it!",
    "svo5030_037": "Leave 'em to me!",
    "svo5030_038": "None of you are hurt, are you?!",
    "svo5030_039": "Us? What about you? Are you okay?",
    "svo5030_040": "Yes, I'm perfectly fine. No issues.",
    "svo5030_041": "What were you doing here all by yourself, Neige?",
    "svo5030_042": "Well, uh...",
    "svo5030_043": "I was concerned I'd worry you all if you saw me crying yet again.",
    "svo5030_044": "So I went to find someplace I could be by myself and ended up here.",
    "svo5030_045": "I see. But y'know, it's real dangerous to wander all by yourself.",
    "svo5030_046": "I'm sorry.",
    "svo5030_047": "Those monsters were all my fault, too.\r\nMaybe they went after me because they saw I was alone.",
    "svo5030_048": "I'm such a failure.",
    "svo5030_049": "N-Neige.",
    "svo5030_050": "Y-Yes?",
    "svo5030_051": "I'm glad you are safe.",
    "svo5030_052": "Alice.",
    "svo5030_053": "Don't worry 'bout a thing!\r\nThose monsters were just a coincidence, I'm sure of it! So c'mon, chin up!",
    "svo5030_054": "She's right. Everyone makes a fumble or two!",
    "svo5030_055": "Oh yeah, believe me, I've screwed up more times than I can hope to count!",
    "svo5030_056": "But you know what? I learned from them each and every time,\r\nand they led to successes in the future.",
    "svo5030_057": "Yeah. I also screwed up pretty badly this one time.",
    "svo5030_058": "I took a quest without doin' the proper research first and paid dearly for it.",
    "svo5030_059": "Now, I am curious as to what exactly transpired.",
    "svo5030_060": "Well, I accepted a quest on a whim only to find out beating it was a lot harder\r\nthan it looked. Thanks to that, I got a ton of penalties until—",
    "svo5030_061": "Whoops! Almost slipped! The rest's top-secret!",
    "svo5030_062": "But what I can say is that I literally had it drilled into me\r\nhow important doin' your homework first is.",
    "svo5030_063": "I can relate to that sentiment. Back when I was still new to cooking,\r\nI was unfamiliar with the proper temperatures and fried my pancakes to cinders.",
    "svo5030_064": "I can still recall how irked I was, clear as day.",
    "svo5030_065": "Oh, but you got over it and now you can whip up awesome food?",
    "svo5030_066": "A-As long as it's nothing delicate, yes.",
    "svo5030_067": "Well, since we're sharing,\r\nI've also ordered the wrong stock and gotten customers' coffee wrong at times.",
    "svo5030_068": "Even you've failed before, Agil?",
    "svo5030_069": "'Course I have.\r\nGetting old's all about taking one failure after the next.",
    "svo5030_070": "But even if I make mistakes, I just keep my cool so I can cover up for them\r\nbefore anyone notices.",
    "svo5030_071": "Wow, you're so mature, Agil!\r\nEveryone always sees through me in an instant!",
    "svo5030_072": "Heck, just the other day, I put one zero too many in an important work document!",
    "svo5030_073": "What?! D-Do you still have your job?",
    "svo5030_074": "Yeah, but back then even I thought I was gonna get fired!\r\nBut then everyone else pitched in and helped me fix it!",
    "svo5030_075": "Anyway, point is, I screwed up bad, but I still got back on my feet! You can't\r\nbeat yourself up every single time you fail or you'll never get anywhere!",
    "svo5030_076": "I think you could benefit from beating yourself up a little, actually.",
    "svo5030_077": "Amen to that.",
    "svo5030_078": "Yeah, you really should take that stuff more seriously!",
    "svo5030_079": "C'mon guys, cut me some slack, will ya?!",
    "svo5030_080": "Heehee! Thank you all so much.",
    "svo5030_081": "Have you regained your wits?",
    "svo5030_082": "Yes, thanks to all of you.",
    "svo5030_083": "But, um, I didn't come here just to cry in secret.",
    "svo5030_084": "I was trying to work up the courage to find Fuuka and get the truth out of her.",
    "svo5030_085": "But whenever I think about her, I just...",
    "svo5030_086": "It's only natural your heart's a mess when you think about her.\r\nThis is your best friend we're talking about here.",
    "svo5030_087": "Thank you. I appreciate it.",
    "svo5030_088": "Um, Neige? I was actually going to throw a tea—",
    "svo5030_089": "Hey guys!",
    "svo5030_090": "Well hey, it's Kiridude. What's got you so shaken?",
    "svo5030_091": "Did something happen?",
    "svo5030_092": "We're under attack by monsters. Sorry, but could you back us up?\r\nThere's not enough of us.",
    "svo5030_093": "You got it! Last one there's a rotten egg!",
    "svo5030_094": "Hey, no fair!\r\nIt's gonna take more than a head start to beat me!",
    "svo5030_095": "C'mon Neige, let's go!",
    "svo5030_096": "Oh, r-right!",
    "svo5030_097": "Thanks! Over here, guys!",
    "svo5030_098": "You sure about this, Alice?\r\nSeems to me like you were trying to say something.",
    "svo5030_099": "It doesn't matter.\r\nReinforcing Kirito takes priority.",
    "svo5030_100": "You're preppin' a tea party for Neige, yeah?",
    "svo5030_101": "...So you knew?",
    "svo5030_102": "C'mon, information like this falls on my lap in no time.",
    "svo5030_103": "I had no idea. Well, since you've come this far,\r\nyou should try telling her again once the dust settles.",
    "svo5030_104": "Forget about it.\r\nI had an epiphany just now, you see.",
    "svo5030_105": "What Neige wants more than anything is to find Fuuka\r\nand discover the truth as soon as possible.",
    "svo5030_106": "While a tea party would certainly help,\r\nwe should be expanding our efforts to grant Neige's wish posthaste.",
    "svo5030_107": "You sure?",
    "svo5030_108": "Yes. We can have the tea party after Fuuka returns to us.",
    "svo5030_109": "I'm certain Neige will enjoy it more that way.",
    "svo5030_110": "But hey, I'm invited too, yeah?",
    "svo5030_111": "Naturally.",
    "svo5030_112": "Well, if you say so, then let's go and lend those guys a hand!",
    "svo5030_113": "Indeed!",
    "svo5031_001": "They should be arriving any minute now.",
    "svo5031_002": "Alice!",
    "svo5031_003": "Welcome to the tea party.",
    "svo5031_004": "Thank you so much for inviting us, Alice.",
    "svo5031_005": "I'm really excited to see what a tea party hosted by you will be like.",
    "svo5031_006": "Quite! Long have I awaited this day!",
    "svo5031_007": "Alice put together this party quite some time ago to lift Fuuka's spirits.",
    "svo5031_008": "What?! R-Really?",
    "svo5031_009": "You hear that?\r\nThat means you need to have enough fun for everyone today!",
    "svo5031_010": "O-Okay!",
    "svo5031_011": "Thank you so much for everything, Alice.\r\nI'll do all that I can to have fun!",
    "svo5031_012": "Hey now, fun's not something you make an effort to have.",
    "svo5031_013": "Huh?! Th-This sure is confusing.",
    "svo5031_014": "Heheh. Just be yourself, Fuuka.",
    "svo5031_015": "She's right. Relax.",
    "svo5031_016": "O-Okay!",
    "svo5031_017": "Take this, Alice. It's a little present from me.",
    "svo5031_018": "Lady Cardinal, isn't this...?",
    "svo5031_019": "I thought it fitting for today's tea party.\r\nI recommend putting it to use right away.",
    "svo5031_020": "Yes, ma'am!",
    "svo5031_021": "How is it?",
    "svo5031_022": "Wow, so cute!",
    "svo5031_023": "That looks great, Alice!",
    "svo5031_024": "Indeed it does.",
    "svo5031_025": "They're right, it looks lovely on you.\r\nDoesn't it, Kirito?",
    "svo5031_026": "Yeah. It's perfect for you.",
    "svo5031_027": "Wearing this outfit is a bit embarrassing, though.",
    "svo5031_028": "But I like it. Thank you very much, Lady Cardinal.",
    "svo5031_029": "Glad you like it.\r\nConsider it a reward for our hardworking host.",
    "svo5031_030": "Without further ado, I shall brew the tea.\r\nPlease, take your seats, people.",
    "svo5031_031": "This is the best tea party I've ever been part of.",
    "svo5031_032": "Thank you for putting this all together for me, Alice.",
    "svo5031_033": "Think nothing of it. It is Lady Cardinal who deserves your gratitude.\r\nThis whole production was her idea.",
    "svo5031_034": "All I did was suggest it.\r\nIt was you who made it the splendid masterpiece it is now, Alice.",
    "svo5031_035": "These pastries are simply wonderful!\r\nYou made these using the ingredients we scrounged up back then, didn't you?",
    "svo5031_036": "Indeed.\r\nThey came out even better than expected, thanks to Asuna's help.",
    "svo5031_037": "Thank you, Asuna.",
    "svo5031_038": "Don't mention it, I was just really pumped for this.",
    "svo5031_039": "On another note, I'm surprised you found such nice tea leaves.\r\nWhere did you get them?",
    "svo5031_040": "Well, actually, Oberon told us where we could find some.",
    "svo5031_041": "Wait, he did?",
    "svo5031_042": "I'm surprised he even helped.\r\nThough he does seem the type who would know his tea.",
    "svo5031_043": "A constant bellyacher though he may have been,\r\nhe was also of great assistance in this matter.",
    "svo5031_044": "Wow. What do you know?",
    "svo5031_045": "Say, Alice?\r\nThis tea smells really good and makes me feel at ease.",
    "svo5031_046": "That's because it's herbal tea.",
    "svo5031_047": "You mean you even went to the trouble of gathering herbs, too?\r\nServing more than one type of tea shows some great consideration on your part.",
    "svo5031_048": "Actually, Sinon, Leafa, and Eiji gathered these herbs.",
    "svo5031_049": "You certainly found a lot of them.\r\nI doubt we'll be able to get through all of them in just a day.",
    "svo5031_050": "They are indeed plentiful in both number and variety,\r\nthanks to those three sparing absolutely no effort.",
    "svo5031_051": "So not only did you manage to get everyone to help,\r\nyou even put on a fantastic tea party. You're something else, Alice.",
    "svo5031_052": "Perhaps Alice has a talent for bringing people together.",
    "svo5031_053": "Hardly, at least compared to you, Kirito.\r\nIt is all thanks to you that I managed to form bonds with so many individuals.",
    "svo5031_054": "You think so?",
    "svo5031_055": "Oh yes, I feel like you have a knack for attracting friends wherever you go,\r\nKirito.",
    "svo5031_056": "Yeah, you can say that again.",
    "svo5031_057": "See? Even Eugeo and Asuna agree.",
    "svo5031_058": "Mmm, I don't know.",
    "svo5031_059": "Hehehe.",
    "svo5031_060": "...",
    "svo5031_061": "Are you enjoying yourself, Fuuka?",
    "svo5031_062": "Oh yes, very much. Thank you so much, Alice.",
    "svo5031_063": "I'm simply glad to hear this managed to lift your spirits.",
    "svo5031_064": "I wish Neige could've been here with us, though.",
    "svo5031_065": "Fuuka.",
    "svo5031_066": "But I'll get her back.\r\nNo matter how long or difficult a fight that may be.",
    "svo5031_067": "I'm sure she'd love a party like this.\r\nAnd maybe, just maybe—",
    "svo5031_068": "Indeed. Let us all hold another tea party when she comes back to us.",
    "svo5031_069": "Just hang tight, okay, Neige?",
    "svo8001_001": "You did great, Kirito.",
    "svo8001_002": "Thanks, Asuna. You were a big help too, Yui.",
    "svo8001_003": "You're welcome! I'm just glad I could fight alongside you both!",
    "svo8001_004": "Still, I'm surprised at just how many people got together here\r\npast the world's boundaries.",
    "svo8001_005": "You're telling me. If we weren't in such a situation, I think a lot more \r\npeople would've opted to be lone wolves.",
    "svo8001_006": "True... Even though everyone here has a single weapon, they're all different.\r\nTell me, who was the easiest person to fight alongside?",
    "svo8001_007": "Hmm, well, it was easy to fight with everyone, but—",
    "svo8001_008": "Me, most likely.",
    "svo8001_009": "Wha—?! Alice?",
    "svo8001_010": "Kirito and I are comrades who have fought side-by-side and escaped danger many a\r\ntime by now. We understand each other so well that not even the mightiest of\r\nfoes are a match for us.",
    "svo8001_011": "...",
    "svo8001_012": "Well, I'd say I'm most compatible with him. We're siblings, after all!",
    "svo8001_013": "We've lived and trained together ever since we were little,\r\nso I've spent more time with him than anyone else.",
    "svo8001_014": "Hey, that doesn't count! Things in real life and in-game are different.\r\nI mean, you use different weapons out there, naturally.",
    "svo8001_015": "And don't forget, I know Kirito's weapons better than anyone!\r\nI'd say that makes me his best partner.",
    "svo8001_016": "Leafa, Liz...\r\nWhen did this become a discussion about partners?",
    "svo8001_017": "D-Don't count me out! Kirito not only taught me a ton,\r\nbut he even saved me and Pina!",
    "svo8001_018": "Pina, Kirito, and I form a trio that can fight in ways that no one else can,\r\nso I'm just as good of a partner as the rest!",
    "svo8001_019": "I guess Kirito does have a number of good options for partners. In that body,\r\nthat is. But it's a different story when he's got a gun and photon sword.",
    "svo8001_020": "Isn't that right, Kirito?",
    "svo8001_021": "Silica, Sinon, not you, too.",
    "svo8001_022": "Mommy's the best one for Daddy, obviously!\r\nThey wouldn't be Mommy and Daddy if they weren't!",
    "svo8001_023": "Y-Yeah. Of course I—",
    "svo8001_024": "Dang, still the same player as always, eh, Kii-boy.",
    "svo8001_025": "Argo! Please, I'm begging you, it's a madhouse here.\r\nYou've got to restore some order.",
    "svo8001_026": "You guys are all fools.\r\nI've worked with Kii-boy longer than any of ya when it comes to VRMMOs.",
    "svo8001_027": "Not you too, Argo.",
    "svo8001_028": "Hehe.",
    "svo8001_029": "You all speak of compatibility.\r\nIn other words, whoever is best at taming him, yes?",
    "svo8001_030": "Uh, not exactly. I think?",
    "svo8001_031": "Well, all it would take is a little tuning on my part to turn you into\r\nmy perfect puppet—I mean, partner, was it?",
    "svo8001_032": "P-Pretty sure I just heard you say \"puppet.\"",
    "svo8001_033": "Kirito sure makes a great partner, that's for sure!\r\nIt sure is easy fighting alongside a fellow one-handed swordsman!",
    "svo8001_034": "But I'd have to say Asuna's the best partner I could ask for.\r\nI never have to worry when I'm in combat with her!",
    "svo8001_035": "I think me and Kirito would be the fastest team in the world.\r\nIf we worked together, we could take out just about anyone in a flash!",
    "svo8001_036": "Oh come on, he and I are both dual-wielders,\r\nso he and I would kick some serious butt together too, I just know it!",
    "svo8001_037": "Come to think of it, I don't believe I've ever heard Kirito sing before.\r\nI would certainly like to see what sort of harmony we could create.",
    "svo8001_038": "So sing! Sing for me, Kirito!",
    "svo8001_039": "This conversation got so derailed it isn't even funny.",
    "svo8001_040": "Stop it, all of you! Daddy is Daddy because he has Mommy!",
    "svo8001_041": "Please Mommy, you've got to say something too!",
    "svo8001_042": "I mean, you're not wrong, but when you really think about it,\r\nit's actually really hard to decide who works best with him.",
    "svo8001_043": "It'd be nice if everyone came to realize that.\r\nDon't you agree, Kirito?",
    "svo8001_044": "Yeah. You're right, Asuna.",
    "svo8001_045": "Classic Asuna. Always calm and composed, eh?",
    "svo8001_046": "Ugh, why does Kirito get all the ladies?",
    "svo8001_047": "Well, as much he complains about getting mixed up in others' troubles, he makes\r\nsure things turn out all right. His page Ronie was particularly fond of him.",
    "svo8001_048": "Hey, I'm not the only one that draws attention.\r\nTiese was just as attached to you.",
    "svo8001_049": "Sure, but I never gave my instructor flowers.",
    "svo8001_050": "Hmmm?",
    "svo8001_051": "We've been through this, Eugeo.\r\nI only did that to thank Liena for her help.",
    "svo8001_052": "So what you're saying is in the end you're the one who always looks good.\r\nThat's just not fair, Kirito!",
    "svo8002_001": "Whew. Looks like we finally have a moment to ourselves, huh?",
    "svo8002_002": "Yeah, guess the dust's finally settled.\r\nStill, that was exhausting.",
    "svo8002_003": "That reminds me, good work out there, Kirito.",
    "svo8002_004": "Yeah, you too, Asuna.",
    "svo8002_005": "Guess our journey's over at last, isn't it?\r\nI can't remember the last time we had time alone like this.",
    "svo8002_006": "Yeah, it didn't feel right to just relax and chat earlier\r\nunder the circumstances.",
    "svo8002_007": "You were great, Kirito.",
    "svo8002_008": "But everyone had to save me again.",
    "svo8002_009": "You're talking about the cognitive contamination thing?",
    "svo8002_010": "Yes.\r\nMy memories were such a mess back then that I had no idea what was going on.",
    "svo8002_011": "I heard you thought you were still the vice commander\r\nof the Knights of the Blood Oath.",
    "svo8002_012": "So I did. And while my memories came back,\r\nit still scares me to think of what would've happened to me if they hadn't.",
    "svo8002_013": "Asuna...",
    "svo8002_014": "I'm also scared of getting trapped in that world\r\nand the danger that lurks there.",
    "svo8002_015": "But what scares me most is the thought of forgetting everything\r\nand not even knowing who you are.",
    "svo8002_016": "It's almost like when I started losing my memories during the Ordinal Scale\r\nincident. Maybe this is just my lot in life.",
    "svo8002_017": "...",
    "svo8002_018": "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to turn this into a downer.\r\nWe haven't had much time with only the two of us,\r\nand I know this isn't how either of us wants to spend it.",
    "svo8002_019": "Asuna...",
    "svo8002_020": "Don't you worry about a thing. I swear I'll keep you safe.",
    "svo8002_021": "I'll always be there to remind you of everything.\r\nEven if centuries pass, I'll make you remember.",
    "svo8002_022": "Kirito...",
    "svo8002_023": "Thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me.",
    "svo8002_024": "We'll always be there for each other, no matter where life takes us or how much\r\ntime passes.",
    "svo8002_025": "Always. I want to spend the rest of my life with you, too.\r\nForever and ever.",
    "svo8002_026": "Hee hee, I feel a lot better now! Thanks, Kirito.",
    "svo8002_027": "Glad to hear it.",
    "svo8002_028": "By the way, what do you say we take a walk together?\r\nLike the old days?",
    "svo8002_029": "Huh, come to think of it,\r\nwe haven't gone for a stroll in a really long time, have we?",
    "svo8002_030": "I know, right? Come on. Let's shuffle our feet.",
    "svo8002_031": "This reminds me of living together back when we were stuck in SAO.",
    "svo8002_032": "Oh, yeah. This is like that time when you asked me to give you a piggyback ride.\r\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
    "svo8002_033": "Hey, I couldn't help myself.\r\nI was excited to finally have a moment to really breathe.",
    "svo8002_034": "I still remember the time we had that fishing tournament with Mr. Nishida\r\nand the others like it was only yesterday.",
    "svo8002_035": "Oh yeah, for the Sea King, right?\r\nThough it was kinda big for a king, if you ask me.",
    "svo8002_036": "Hee hee! Remember the looks on everyone's faces?\r\nThe thought of it still makes me smile.",
    "svo8002_037": "That little period in our lives really was the best, wasn't it?",
    "svo8002_038": "Yeah, it was nice to kick back and live each day as it came.",
    "svo8002_039": "Not only that, but we got to meet people living ordinary lives like Mr. Nishida,\r\nand we found Yui.",
    "svo8002_040": "It broke my heart when I saw her back then.\r\nBecause she was wandering around with no memories, I mean.",
    "svo8002_041": "She sure was different from the dependable Yui we know now.\r\nThinking about then and now makes me realize how much she's changed.",
    "svo8002_042": "Indeed. Though I'd say we've changed, too.",
    "svo8002_043": "We're completely different people than the boy and girl who got stuck in SAO.",
    "svo8002_044": "You can say that again.\r\nWe've grown quite a lot if I do say so myself.",
    "svo8002_045": "But that said, my feelings for you will never change.\r\nNo matter what the future holds.",
    "svo8002_046": "I don't know if I can say the same for myself.",
    "svo8002_047": "Wait, really?",
    "svo8002_048": "Yes. You see, well, I love you more and more day after day,\r\nso my feelings are constantly changing.",
    "svo8002_049": "Hah! So that's your angle.",
    "svo8002_050": "Well, that makes two of us.\r\nAfter all, I love you much more than I did back then.",
    "svo8002_051": "Hee hee! I guess that makes us birds of a feather.",
    "svo8002_052": "Know I'll never stop loving you, Kirito.\r\nForever and always.",
    "svo8003_001": "...",
    "svo8003_002": "Sinon?",
    "svo8003_003": "Kirito...",
    "svo8003_004": "Finally found you. So this is where you were.",
    "svo8003_005": "Yes, well... I wanted to be alone for a little.",
    "svo8003_006": "Hey, you okay? Sounds to me like something's eating at you.\r\nCan I do anything to help?",
    "svo8003_007": "Heh, I appreciate the concern, but it's no big deal, really.",
    "svo8003_008": "I was just doing some reflecting now that everything's finally settled down,\r\nand I have a moment to relax.",
    "svo8003_009": "I never would have pegged you for the type.",
    "svo8003_010": "Oh? And what did you peg me for?",
    "svo8003_011": "Nothing weird, really. It's just that you're always so calm,\r\nI never pictured you just spacing out or anything.",
    "svo8003_012": "I admit I'm happy to hear that, but even I get stressed, you know?",
    "svo8003_013": "Yeah, I guess even you'd need a break at the end of the day,\r\nespecially when things get so hectic.",
    "svo8003_014": "Yes. That's why I'm cooling off now.\r\nI don't know, maybe it's just because I was tense from our opponent this time.",
    "svo8003_015": "You mean Gabriel?",
    "svo8003_016": "Yes. We'd fought before,\r\nand knowing his might ahead of time really put the pressure on.",
    "svo8003_017": "You can say that again.\r\nI definitely wasn't expecting to see him there.",
    "svo8003_018": "Say, that reminds me, didn't Gabriel make his first appearance\r\nwhen we were fighting a boss monster?",
    "svo8003_019": "I still remember how stunned LLENN and Fuka were when you suddenly told us\r\nto focus on him instead of the boss.",
    "svo8003_020": "Yeah. You were a big help wasting no time in attacking him.\r\nYou jumped in with zero explanation.",
    "svo8003_021": "I'm just glad I was there to make sense of everything.",
    "svo8003_022": "Me, too. You really have a knack for saving my skin when I need it,\r\nyou know that? Thanks.",
    "svo8003_023": "No need to thank me. I just did what anyone would have.",
    "svo8003_024": "Besides, I'm used to keeping your butt covered.",
    "svo8003_025": "Heh, well, I wanted to be sure you know you're appreciated for all the pickles\r\nyou've pulled me out of.",
    "svo8003_026": "Don't mention it.",
    "svo8003_027": "After all, I can never repay you for all you've done for me.",
    "svo8003_028": "You don't owe me for anything.\r\nLike you said, we do what anyone would.",
    "svo8003_029": "So you don't have to feel like you're indebted to me.",
    "svo8003_030": "You say that, but...",
    "svo8003_031": "No, never mind.\r\nMaybe the idea I'm doing this to repay you is just an excuse anyway.",
    "svo8003_032": "An excuse for what?",
    "svo8003_033": "Sticking with you, there's never a dull moment.\r\nAnd while I'm at it, I just do what I can.",
    "svo8003_034": "Maybe that's what's really going on here.",
    "svo8003_035": "I enjoy your company too, so I'm happy to hear that.",
    "svo8003_036": "Heh, thanks.",
    "svo8003_037": "In any case, I've got your back whenever you need it,\r\nso don't ever worry about your six.",
    "svo8003_038": "Good to know. I can focus on fighting out on the frontlines without a second\r\nthought with you around.",
    "svo8003_039": "So you say, but don't take my presence as an excuse\r\nto pull any crazy stunts out there, you understand?",
    "svo8003_040": "Oh, I, uh... I'll keep that in mind.",
    "svo8003_041": "Sheesh, you think I'll buy that, coming from you?\r\nI'm serious here. Watch yourself.",
    "svo8003_042": "Besides, when you go too far ahead...",
    "svo8003_043": "...Be careful not to leave me lonely.",
    "svo8003_044": "Wait, seriously?",
    "svo8003_045": "N-Never mind, forget I said anything!\r\nI just wanted to see how you'd react to me saying that!",
    "svo8003_046": "C-Come on, let's just go back to the others, all right?",
    "svo8003_047": "Sinon.",
    "svo8003_048": "H-Hey, what's with the scary look on your face?",
    "svo8003_049": "Listen carefully. I'll never forget you've got me covered.\r\nNo matter how far I run, Sinon.",
    "svo8003_050": "Kirito...",
    "svo8003_051": "Yeah, I know. I've known for ages now.",
    "svo8003_052": "I'm sorry. I know I was being selfish just now.",
    "svo8003_053": "But remember, there's one thing I'll never budge on.\r\nI'll keep your back covered so you'll never have to turn around.",
    "svo8003_054": "Thanks, Sinon. I won't forget that, I swear.",
    "svo8003_055": "Oh, but that also means I'll have to keep how you mentioned you get lonely\r\nin mind, too.",
    "svo8003_056": "Don't! Seriously!",
    "svo8003_057": "You sure?\r\nIt's not every day I get to see that side of you.",
    "svo8003_058": "I mean it! Wipe it from your mind!",
    "svo8004_001": "Whew, this whole thing really took a lot outta me!",
    "svo8004_002": "You helped out a ton, Sugu.",
    "svo8004_003": "You too, Kazuto!",
    "svo8004_004": "It sure was a lot more hectic this time, wasn't it?\r\nWay busier than usual.",
    "svo8004_005": "Haha, you've got that right.\r\nI'd say it was much more lively, for sure.",
    "svo8004_006": "I'm just glad we all made it through this situation in one piece!",
    "svo8004_007": "Yeah. Honestly, I didn't really know what would happen when we were all scattered around.",
    "svo8004_008": "Me neither. With people having their memories and perception altered, it wasn't a normal situation.",
    "svo8004_009": "Hey, Kazuto...",
    "svo8004_010": "Hmm? What's wrong? You're looking a little blue.",
    "svo8004_011": "It's just...\r\nYou know how I attacked you when we first came across each other in here?",
    "svo8004_012": "I know I wasn't in my right mind when it happened and all...",
    "svo8004_013": "But still, I'm so sorry for that.\r\nI really put you through hell, didn't I?",
    "svo8004_014": "Don't even think about it.\r\nHelping each other out is what family's for.",
    "svo8004_015": "Though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't freaking out to be fighting you.",
    "svo8004_016": "Thanks again for snapping me out of it, Kazuto.",
    "svo8004_017": "It gives me the shivers to think I could've hurt someone back then...",
    "svo8004_018": "Give yourself more credit.\r\nI know you would've come to your senses before it ever came to that.",
    "svo8004_019": "You really think so?",
    "svo8004_020": "I know so.",
    "svo8004_021": "After all, you didn't take up the sword to hurt people,\r\nand you've been way more serious about your kendo training than me.",
    "svo8004_022": "But it's your kind heart above all else that tells me you never would've even\r\nconsidered it. I'm positive.",
    "svo8004_023": "Thanks, Kazuto. I'm so glad you stopped me.",
    "svo8004_024": "Whew, that's a huge load off my mind!\r\nWhat a relief to finally have that off my chest!",
    "svo8004_025": "You could've talked to me about it sooner if it was eating you.\r\nNo need to be shy.",
    "svo8004_026": "I mean, yeah, but I never really had a good time before now.",
    "svo8004_027": "Besides, you've been working so hard to help everyone put this incident to bed,\r\nso I wanted to focus on helping you.",
    "svo8004_028": "Thanks for that.\r\nI can rest easy knowing you're always there to give me a hand.",
    "svo8004_029": "Same here. I can stay strong because you're here with me.",
    "svo8004_030": "It's like, I feel like everything's gonna be okay as long as you're around.\r\nAnd it's all thanks to how strong you are.",
    "svo8004_031": "I'm not as strong as you think.",
    "svo8004_032": "I've made plenty of mistakes so far,\r\nand I'm sure they're far from over.",
    "svo8004_033": "Don't say that. This is you we're talking about, I'm sure you'll...\r\nNo, I KNOW you'll be fine.",
    "svo8004_034": "Are you really that confident about it?",
    "svo8004_035": "Yep! You're a kind and caring person,\r\nso believe me when I say you're gonna be just fine.",
    "svo8004_036": "And besides, I'll always be there for you, right by your side.",
    "svo8004_037": "Sugu...",
    "svo8004_038": "If you ever feel like the weight of the world's crushing you,\r\njust let your sister know and she'll share the load with you! Sound good?",
    "svo8004_039": "Yeah, sounds good.\r\nI can take on anything as long as you're there with me.",
    "svo8004_040": "Heehee, glad you finally got that through your skull!",
    "svo8004_041": "Oh, but don't think that means you can just go off risking your life\r\nlike a daredevil. I'm sure this incident's made that crystal clear.",
    "svo8004_042": "Uh... Yeah, sure.",
    "svo8004_043": "Oh come on, wanna try saying that again like you actually mean it this time?",
    "svo8004_044": "Hey, Sugu, we really should be getting back to the others now.",
    "svo8004_045": "Not so fast, Kazuto!\r\nDon't think you're getting out of this that easy! Hey!",
    "svo8005_001": "Hello? Earth to Liz?",
    "svo8005_002": "Oh for crying out loud, there's so many new materials!",
    "svo8005_003": "Hold on a sec...\r\nI could take some notes from this weapon to make new enhancements.",
    "svo8005_004": "Huh? No... Yeah, of course! Then I do a little of that... and then this!\r\nMan, I'm having a blast!",
    "svo8005_005": "She's off in her own little world...",
    "svo8005_006": "Oh, hey there, Kirito.\r\nKinda creepy how you're standing back and watching.",
    "svo8005_007": "Uh, sorry, you seemed busy, so I didn't want to interrupt.",
    "svo8005_008": "You can say that again!\r\nI'm busier than the busiest bee who ever bumbled!",
    "svo8005_009": "But at least it's the fun kind of busy.\r\nYou know, when there's so much you WANT to do, instead of stuff you HAVE to do.",
    "svo8005_010": "Ahaha, glad to hear it.",
    "svo8005_011": "Anyway, whatcha want?",
    "svo8005_012": "Oh, well, uh...",
    "svo8005_013": "(I'd feel like a jerk getting in the way of all her fun...)",
    "svo8005_014": "Ah, nothing. It can wait.\r\nJust take care of what's on your plate first.",
    "svo8005_015": "Aw, c'mon, don't be a stranger. I'm all ears!",
    "svo8005_016": "Now gimme your sword.",
    "svo8005_017": "Huh?",
    "svo8005_018": "You were going to ask me to tune it up, weren't you?\r\nIt's written all over your face.",
    "svo8005_019": "I mean, yes, but... aren't you busy?",
    "svo8005_020": "For the love of... Kirito, I'm your personal blacksmith.\r\nAnd I take that job very seriously.",
    "svo8005_021": "Good point. Thanks, I'd appreciate it.",
    "svo8005_022": "Hoo boy, you really put this baby through the wringer again, didn't you?\r\nLooks like it's about to break.",
    "svo8005_023": "Ahaha...",
    "svo8005_024": "Oof, this part in particular's had it rough.\r\nBut it should be okay with a little work.",
    "svo8005_025": "Think you can fix it?",
    "svo8005_026": "What, didn't you hear me? It'll sparkle like new—\r\nNo, better than new when I'm through with it.",
    "svo8005_027": "This sword means a lot to me too, you know.",
    "svo8005_028": "Wow, I had no idea you were so attached to my sword.\r\nBut I'm really happy to hear that.",
    "svo8005_029": "Yeah, uh... it's not just the sword I'm attached to.",
    "svo8005_030": "Really?",
    "svo8005_031": "But enough of that.",
    "svo8005_032": "I shouldn't be long. Sit back and watch the master at work.",
    "svo8005_033": "You've got it.",
    "svo8005_034": "Bit off topic, but boy was that journey something, wasn't it?",
    "svo8005_035": "While I don't think I could ever rank all of them,\r\nthis one was as crazy as the rest.",
    "svo8005_036": "But while you surprising me is nothing new,\r\nit was still startling all the same when you suddenly ran off to help Yui.",
    "svo8005_037": "Sorry. But it was urgent.",
    "svo8005_038": "I know. You'd run through fire if it meant saving Yui.",
    "svo8005_039": "Oh, hey, that's right!\r\nYou mentioned there was this time when Klein got stuck in a cage, right?",
    "svo8005_040": "Yeah. Poor guy.",
    "svo8005_041": "I'm glad I wasn't there.\r\nI don't think I could've stopped myself from laughing my head off.",
    "svo8005_042": "Man, looking back on it all,\r\nthe whole thing was one whirlwind moment after the next.",
    "svo8005_043": "There were both good and bad times...\r\nbut I think you and this sword really did great out there.",
    "svo8005_044": "So did you. Give yourself some credit.",
    "svo8005_045": "...",
    "svo8005_046": "Hey, by the way... You've been watching me work for a while now.",
    "svo8005_047": "And honestly, you're making it really hard for me when you do.",
    "svo8005_048": "But... I thought you asked me to watch.",
    "svo8005_049": "It was a figure of speech! I meant wait! That's all!",
    "svo8005_050": "Sorry, but if you ask me, I think anyone would be captivated by such stunning\r\nwork. I'm still in awe, myself.",
    "svo8005_051": "Seriously though, thank you so much.\r\nI don't know where I'd be without your skills.",
    "svo8005_052": "H-Hey! E-Enough with the sudden heap of compliments...",
    "svo8005_053": "Aaaaaand... done!",
    "svo8005_054": "Just so you know, all that flattery isn't gonna make me\r\nthrow in a bonus or anything!",
    "svo8005_055": "Wow, Liz, you've outdone yourself this time.\r\nI barely even recognize it.",
    "svo8005_056": "Sheesh, you do realize that's not saying much when you brought it in all but\r\nbroken, don't you?",
    "svo8005_057": "Still, I know telling you to take it easy's not gonna work,\r\nso lemme say this...",
    "svo8005_058": "Bring this back whenever it needs maintenance.\r\nI'll fix it up every time.",
    "svo8005_059": "You got it.",
    "svo8005_060": "After all, I've only got the highest of hopes for my personal blacksmith.",
    "svo8005_061": "Ugh, turn down the charm, will ya?!",
    "svo8006_001": "Kirito!",
    "svo8006_002": "Hey, Silica. What's up?",
    "svo8006_003": "Are you good on time?!",
    "svo8006_004": "Well, I found the prettiest little field of flowers,\r\nso I was wondering if you'd like to come along!",
    "svo8006_005": "Ooh, sounds nice. Sure, I'm game.",
    "svo8006_006": "Hmm, I wonder... Who else would be free to tag along?",
    "svo8006_007": "Mmph...",
    "svo8006_008": "Silica?",
    "svo8006_009": "I meant for us to go by ourselves.",
    "svo8006_010": "Huh?! O-Oh, I see...\r\nSorry I didn't put two and two together.",
    "svo8006_011": "No, it's okay. That's just classic Kirito.",
    "svo8006_012": "Anyway, come with me! I'll show you the way!",
    "svo8006_013": "Wow! This place never gets any less pretty no matter how many times I come by!",
    "svo8006_014": "You're telling me. It's as beautiful as you said it'd be.",
    "svo8006_015": "Over here, Kirito! Look!\r\nSee how many adorable little flowers there are?!",
    "svo8006_016": "Yeah.",
    "svo8006_017": "Boy, you sure don't see many fields like this IRL, do you?!",
    "svo8006_018": "True enough.",
    "svo8006_019": "Uh, Kirito?",
    "svo8006_020": "Huh? Sorry, did you say something?",
    "svo8006_021": "You're thinking about something else right now, aren't you?",
    "svo8006_022": "Ahaha, whoops, didn't mean to. My bad.",
    "svo8006_023": "I know. Why don't I try to guess what it was about?",
    "svo8006_024": "You're worried about if any powerful monsters are nearby.\r\nOr how you'd fight if we got in a battle. Well? Do those sound about right?",
    "svo8006_025": "Well, I, uh... yeah, bullseye.",
    "svo8006_026": "Come on, I already checked to make sure it was safe!\r\nRelax and enjoy the scenery!",
    "svo8006_027": "Okay, okay. I'll drop my guard a little, since you asked.",
    "svo8006_028": "Just a little? You do remember I can fight, too, right?",
    "svo8006_029": "I mean, sure, I'm not as strong as you and the others,\r\nand I know I drag you all down, but still...",
    "svo8006_030": "Whoa, hey, that's not what I was getting at. At all.\r\nSorry if I made you feel that way, though.",
    "svo8006_031": "It's just I've never been here before, so my main concern is your safety.\r\nThat's all.",
    "svo8006_032": "You said you made sure it was safe,\r\nbut a part of me still can't help but worry about a worst-case scenario.",
    "svo8006_033": "It'll be fine. I've got nothing to fear with you around.",
    "svo8006_034": "Besides, I've been working hard so I'm not standing back and letting you do all\r\nthe fighting for me.",
    "svo8006_035": "Yeah, you're right.\r\nSorry about all that, I didn't mean to make light of your capabilities.",
    "svo8006_036": "I know you're not bluffing, either.\r\nI saw what a big help you were during this last journey.",
    "svo8006_037": "Mmph...",
    "svo8006_038": "Uh... did I say something wrong?",
    "svo8006_039": "...That's not good enough.",
    "svo8006_040": "Huh?",
    "svo8006_041": "You say I was a big help, but tell me how! Explain to me what exactly it was\r\nI did! And don't you leave out a single detail!",
    "svo8006_042": "Okay, well...",
    "svo8006_043": "Remember how you were always there for Neige whenever she needed a shoulder\r\nto lean on? You really came in the clutch there.",
    "svo8006_044": "You also were the one who reached out to Yuna.\r\nThings could've been a lot rockier if it weren't for that.",
    "svo8006_045": "But the biggest thing of all, I'd have to say, was getting Death Gun to join us.\r\nThat was mostly you. I sure couldn't have pulled it off.",
    "svo8006_046": "See now? You really were a big help, Silica. Thanks.",
    "svo8006_047": "...",
    "svo8006_048": "Silica?",
    "svo8006_049": "O-Omigosh...",
    "svo8006_050": "I-I can't believe you were keeping such a close eye on me.\r\nThis is too much! How embarrassing!",
    "svo8006_051": "Uh, but weren't you the one who asked me for those details?",
    "svo8006_052": "I'm sorry! I was only teasing you!\r\nI thought it'd be funny to see you squirm a little!",
    "svo8006_053": "Ahaha, so that's what this was about.",
    "svo8006_054": "But I didn't have any trouble remembering your contributions.\r\nNothing about what you did made me squirm at all.",
    "svo8006_055": "Stop! Just stop!\r\nOh god, I'm so embarrassed I can't even look at you.",
    "svo8006_056": "Th-The flowers! Look at the flowers, Kirito! Please!\r\nThat's what we came here to do!",
    "svo8006_057": "Good idea. I think I'll do just that.",
    "svo8006_058": "Hey Silica, are you okay? Your face is red as a tomato.",
    "svo8006_059": "Don't look at me! Please!",
    "svo8007_001": "Heheh.",
    "svo8007_002": "Hmm?",
    "svo8007_003": "Ah, nothing. I was thinking about how fun it is being with you.",
    "svo8007_004": "Whoa, that came out of nowhere.",
    "svo8007_005": "No it didn't. I've always felt that way.",
    "svo8007_006": "It was so much fun meeting all those people and fighting with them this time\r\naround. Whole thing was a roller coaster from start to finish.",
    "svo8007_007": "But that's only because you were there for me.\r\nI doubt it would've been anywhere as entertaining otherwise.",
    "svo8007_008": "I know what you mean, it's fun having you around for me, too.\r\nIt's like every moment with you's an adventure.",
    "svo8007_009": "You really mean that?! If so, I'm glad you feel that way.",
    "svo8007_010": "I do. I've felt that way ever since I first dueled the Absolute Sword.",
    "svo8007_011": "What?! But back then, I—",
    "svo8007_012": "I know. You took me away after the duel without so much as a word.",
    "svo8007_013": "Yeah, sorry about that. I got so excited when I realized you were exactly the\r\nkind of person I'd been looking for.",
    "svo8007_014": "Well, if I'd been against it, I would have turned you down when you offered me\r\nyour hand. But I didn't.",
    "svo8007_015": "Then we and the rest of the Sleeping Knights\r\nteamed up to beat that boss and celebrated.",
    "svo8007_016": "It's never a dull moment with you around, Yuuki.\r\nI really mean that.",
    "svo8007_017": "C-C'mon, you're making me blush.",
    "svo8007_018": "Still, I'm happy to know you feel that way.",
    "svo8007_019": "After all, you mean a lot to me.",
    "svo8007_020": "If you didn't, then I wouldn't treasure the memories we made together as much as I do.",
    "svo8007_021": "Well, in that case, we need to keep adding to that treasure horde.\r\nLet's go visit some more places, just the two of us.",
    "svo8007_022": "It's a date!",
    "svo8007_023": "Oh, but since we've got all these people with us right now, I'd like to try\r\nmaking friends with them. They sure are a colorful bunch, aren't they?",
    "svo8007_024": "I mean, we've got LLENN, Fukaziroh, and Sinon, who all use guns,\r\nand then we've got weirdos like Quinella and Heathcliff.",
    "svo8007_025": "Oh, and speaking of weird, Alice and Eugeo are kinda odd too. They're very... unique?\r\nI dunno, they don't really seem like normal video game characters.",
    "svo8007_026": "Yes, I know what you mean.",
    "svo8007_027": "Oh, right, and Yuna too, of course!\r\nI've never met such a good singer before!",
    "svo8007_028": "Best thing is, that's only a few of them! This whole thing made me realize\r\nthe world's a big place I still know so little about.",
    "svo8007_029": "Thinking about all the places and worlds I've never seen before\r\ngets me so stoked!",
    "svo8007_030": "I'd definitely love to visit those places with you, that's for sure.",
    "svo8007_031": "Me too. I'm sure anywhere would be a blast with you around.",
    "svo8007_032": "Really?! You'd go with me?!",
    "svo8007_033": "Of course. Like I said, it's never a dull moment with you.\r\nSo come on, let's go see those places, you and me.",
    "svo8007_034": "Yeah. Thanks, Asuna.",
    "svo8008_001": "Hey there, Kii-boy. All by yourself? Never thought I'd see the day.",
    "svo8008_002": "Hey, just because I hang out with my friends a lot\r\ndoesn't mean I'm with them 24/7.",
    "svo8008_003": "So ya say, but you're still a far cry from that lone wolf I knew back in Aincrad.",
    "svo8008_004": "You've mellowed out big time since then.",
    "svo8008_005": "You make it sound like I was some kind of grouch.",
    "svo8008_006": "Because ya were! You never noticed?",
    "svo8008_007": "I-I mean, kind of, yeah...",
    "svo8008_008": "Heh, well, as long as you're honest with yourself now.",
    "svo8008_009": "The past aside, you were certainly a big help on this adventure.",
    "svo8008_010": "Ah, don't mention it.\r\n'Sides, I picked up some nice kernels of intel, so consider us even.",
    "svo8008_011": "Kernels of what info?",
    "svo8008_012": "Interpersonal relationships mostly.",
    "svo8008_013": "What do you mean? What did you learn?",
    "svo8008_014": "That you're a much bigger player than I thought.",
    "svo8008_015": "Wh-Whoa, hey, I don't like the implications of that at all.",
    "svo8008_016": "I mean, sure, I already knew ya had Asu, Lisbeth, Silica, and Sinon,\r\nbut Leafa, Alice, and Quinella, too? I can't count 'em all on one hand anymore!",
    "svo8008_017": "There's nothing going on between us! Seriously! Especially not, well, Quinella.\r\nOur connection is... complicated.",
    "svo8008_018": "Wait a minute... You're not going to try to sell this so-called intel\r\non the market, right Argo? Right?",
    "svo8008_019": "Ya know my motto! I'll sell anything for the right price.",
    "svo8008_020": "Well, yeah, but rumors like these will only cause trouble for them.\r\nI can take any nasty whispers, but I don't want my friends to suffer for it.",
    "svo8008_021": "So, ya want me to keep my mouth shut, huh?",
    "svo8008_022": "Yeah. I truly do.",
    "svo8008_023": "Nyeheh... Decisions, decisions...",
    "svo8008_024": "Please Argo, I'm begging you! I'm serious here!",
    "svo8008_025": "Oh really? Then, you'll do anything I ask?",
    "svo8008_026": "Well, uh, \"anything\" might be pushing it, but I'll do what I can.",
    "svo8008_027": "Now now, no need ta panic, I ain't gonna bite.",
    "svo8008_028": "Share with me one of your juiciest secrets that you've never told anybody before. That's the price of my silence.",
    "svo8008_029": "Juicy, huh?\r\nDo I even have a big secret like that which you'd nip at?",
    "svo8008_030": "Nyeheheh.",
    "svo8008_031": "Wh-What's so funny?",
    "svo8008_032": "Look, if ya don't have one, why not make one?",
    "svo8008_033": "What do you mean?",
    "svo8008_034": "Oh, don't play coy. Ya just gotta do somethin' with me now\r\nthat'll be our little secret forever.",
    "svo8008_035": "That'll fulfill your end of the bargain nicely, now won't it?",
    "svo8008_036": "Our little secret...?",
    "svo8008_037": "Now, do I hear a yes, or do I hear a yes?",
    "svo8008_038": "Fine. But go easy on me. Please.",
    "svo8008_039": "That one's all on you.",
    "svo8008_040": "Anywho, let's kick things off by gettin' some grub! Yer treat, of course.\r\nThen, we can take our time chattin' over a bite.",
    "svo8009_001": "Hey there, Kiridude!",
    "svo8009_002": "Oh, hey Klein.",
    "svo8009_003": "Glad I finally got you alone.",
    "svo8009_004": "It's been impossible to get a moment with you these days with how people keep\r\ndraggin' you left and right!",
    "svo8009_005": "You really think so?\r\nI feel like I've still managed to find my fair share of alone time, though.",
    "svo8009_006": "Oh please, you've been busier than Grand Central Station, Kiridude!",
    "svo8009_007": "Not sure about that, but anyway, what do you need?",
    "svo8009_008": "Nothing really.\r\nJust felt like I should do somethin' nice for my pal, that's all.",
    "svo8009_009": "Haha, thanks.",
    "svo8009_010": "So c'mon, tell me, you got something on your chest?\r\nWe've been buds for ages, so no need to hold back.",
    "svo8009_011": "Actually, your timing is perfect.\r\nI was hoping to thank you, truth be told.",
    "svo8009_012": "Specifically, for being there for me during this whole journey.\r\nYou were a lifesaver. Though you had it pretty rough too, right?",
    "svo8009_013": "I wouldn't go so far as to say it was hell or anything, but yeah,\r\nthere sure was a ton of weird stuff. Still, I had fun, strange as it is to say.",
    "svo8009_014": "Besides, weird stuff is par for the course as far as you're concerned.\r\nI consider it part of the package deal these days.",
    "svo8009_015": "Ahaha, sorry.\r\nI never feel good about getting you mixed up in all that madness.",
    "svo8009_016": "Hey, don't sweat it!\r\nFar as I'm concerned, hanging out with you's not such a bad hand to be dealt.",
    "svo8009_017": "Speaking of which, we sure had a lotta people tagging along this time around.\r\nThey're all friends of yours, right?",
    "svo8009_018": "Well, not all of them... but most are, yeah.",
    "svo8009_019": "You've sure got a knack for making connections in places high and low, that's\r\nfor sure. Never could've imagined the Kiridude I met in Aincrad hanging out with\r\nsuch a big crowd.",
    "svo8009_020": "Still, I was the first friend you ever made back in SAO!\r\nDon't you go forgetting that!",
    "svo8009_021": "I wouldn't dream of it.\r\nI still remember meeting you and fighting that boar like it was yesterday.",
    "svo8009_022": "You know, the sword skill you taught me back then was the first big trump card\r\nattack I ever had.",
    "svo8009_023": "Right, that's true.\r\nIt was worth taking all that time to teach you, it seems.",
    "svo8009_024": "Oh yeah, I almost forgot, we both had pretty boy avatars at our first meeting,\r\ndidn't we?! I'm so used to your face now that it almost slipped my mind!",
    "svo8009_025": "Still remember how startled I was when Kayaba unmasked our avatars\r\nand revealed your real face.",
    "svo8009_026": "It was all like,\r\n\"Dang, I thought he was young, but this guy's a total snot-nosed brat!\"",
    "svo8009_027": "Snot-nosed brat?\r\nThat's a bit rich when your own avatar was so overdone to look cool.",
    "svo8009_028": "Hey, nothing wrong with looking awesome!\r\nYou did the same, so you know how it is!",
    "svo8009_029": "I mean, I guess you're not wrong.",
    "svo8009_030": "But man, time really does fly, doesn't it? No sooner did we get outta Aincrad\r\nthan we were hangin' out while taking on ALO.",
    "svo8009_031": "You can say that again.\r\nI don't think I'll ever forget the Excalibur quest we went on.",
    "svo8009_032": "I know, right?! That was like, a super solid adventure we went on\r\nwith no strings attached!",
    "svo8009_033": "And you've only been changing more and more ever since.",
    "svo8009_034": "I know I keep saying it, but who would've thought that lone wolf from SAO\r\nwould've turned into Mr. Popular?",
    "svo8009_035": "So you think I've changed too, huh? It's not just me, then.",
    "svo8009_036": "I never would have dreamed of fighting alongside so many others back when I was\r\ntrying to solo SAO. Not even you.",
    "svo8009_037": "Dude, stop, you're gonna make me cry tears of joy!",
    "svo8009_038": "Joking aside, though, I'm so happy to see how many friends you've made,\r\nand that I'm one of them.",
    "svo8009_039": "Thanks. I know now how much I can't do on my own.",
    "svo8009_040": "Got that right.",
    "svo8009_041": "Still, the others wouldn't be standing tall if they didn't have you.\r\nAnd that goes for me too!",
    "svo8009_042": "So come to me if you ever need a shoulder to lean on!\r\nWe're pals, after all!",
    "svo8009_043": "Ahaha, will do.",
    "svo8009_044": "Good! Then let's stay pals to the end, Kiridude!",
    "svo8010_001": "This turned into another rough journey and a half, eh, Kirito?",
    "svo8010_002": "Yeah, but at least it's all over now.\r\nAnd I couldn't have done it without everyone's help. Most of all yours.",
    "svo8010_003": "Ah, don't sweat it.\r\nI enjoyed getting to fight alongside so many colorful characters.",
    "svo8010_004": "Colorful characters? Yeah, I guess our party does have plenty of idiosyncrasies\r\nwhen you put it like that.",
    "svo8010_005": "You're telling me. People from GGO and Ordinal Scale is one thing, but we even\r\nhad residents of Underworld here too. You're a popular guy, that's for sure.",
    "svo8010_006": "You're implying it's a world of difference from how I used to be, aren't you?",
    "svo8010_007": "Busted, huh?",
    "svo8010_008": "Don't feel bad. We've been friends for years.\r\nOf course, I could tell that was what you were getting at.",
    "svo8010_009": "Speaking of which, there's something I'd like to ask of you, \"old friend.\"",
    "svo8010_010": "You'd better not be pushing something crazy onto me again.",
    "svo8010_011": "What? No, not at all.\r\nI was just wondering if we could have a party now that all this madness is over.",
    "svo8010_012": "A party, eh? Not that I wouldn't be for it,\r\nbut I don't have a bar or shop in this world. You realize that, right?",
    "svo8010_013": "It doesn't have to be at a bar.\r\nAny wide open space where everyone can let loose and have fun works.",
    "svo8010_014": "Ah, now I follow.\r\nLike that picnic we had when the cherry blossoms fell, right?",
    "svo8010_015": "In that case, it shouldn't be a problem.\r\nAll we'll have to do is scrounge up some tables.",
    "svo8010_016": "Thanks, Agil! That's the spirit!",
    "svo8010_017": "Plus, LLENN and Fukaziroh are a sure bet for some rare \r\ningredients. We may even get some ragout rabbit.\r\n",
    "svo8010_018": "Man, I'm still bummed I missed out on that stew...",
    "svo8010_019": "C-Come on, Agil... It's all in the past now.",
    "svo8010_020": "Regrets know no age when it comes to food. But that aside, we're going to need\r\na lot of ingredients if you're planning to invite everyone.",
    "svo8010_021": "I'll get Oberon and Death Gun on that.\r\nTheir egos could use a nice dose of humility. Oh, and Heathcliff too, of course.",
    "svo8010_022": "I think that Quinella chick would pitch in if you asked.",
    "svo8010_023": "I, uh, I don't know about that... But I'll give it a shot.",
    "svo8010_024": "Cooking's gonna be a pain with people from so many different worlds, too.\r\nMight turn out some unexpected dishes, for all we know.",
    "svo8010_025": "Asuna probably could take care of that no problem, though.",
    "svo8010_026": "Great, then let's go and ask them. Oh, but we should also ask if anyone can make\r\na dessert, since we'll have a lot of mouths to feed.",
    "svo8010_027": "What did you have in mind?",
    "svo8010_028": "Well, I don't want to only serve something simple like fruit. It may be on the fancy side, but is a cake possible?",
    "svo8010_029": "Hey, you're only saying that because that's what YOU wanna eat, yeah?\r\nDon't forget that rounding up ingredients for that won't be a walk in the park.",
    "svo8010_030": "I mean, does this world even have any sugar or milk in it?\r\nThough I guess if anyone would know that, it'd probably be Argo.",
    "svo8010_031": "As for eggs, I'm betting bird monsters or something would drop those.",
    "svo8010_032": "Wow, you really are a model trader, Agil!\r\nYou keep coming up with one solution after another!",
    "svo8010_033": "I can see why you're so good at running the Dicey Café IRL, too.\r\nNo wonder the food there's so good!",
    "svo8010_034": "Laying the charm rather thick today, aren't we?",
    "svo8010_035": "You're letting others do all the work while you sit back and watch.\r\nThrow your own back into this for a change, why don't you?",
    "svo8010_036": "O-Okay, sorry. I had every intention of pitching in too, I swear.",
    "svo8010_037": "You're so reliable that I let my mind wander a bit, that's all.",
    "svo8010_038": "Just so you know, that sorta flattery's not gonna get you a discount\r\nat the Dicey Café or anything!",
    "svo8011_001": "Kirito!",
    "svo8011_002": "Hi there, LLENN. Is something up?",
    "svo8011_003": "I just wanted to thank you.\r\nUh, for all your hard work, I mean.",
    "svo8011_004": "Oh, you're welcome.\r\nI'm used to being in hard spots like these for better or worse.",
    "svo8011_005": "If anything, I'd imagine this was rougher on you, seeing as how you knew\r\npractically no one on the team. You don't think so?",
    "svo8011_006": "Hmm... Well, fighting alongside all these new people was a nice change of pace,\r\nI guess. Though we did fight some pretty tough enemies, too.",
    "svo8011_007": "It must have been stressful fighting all those battles one after another then.\r\nSorry to put you through that.",
    "svo8011_008": "Ahaha, not at all! It was just kinda surprising.",
    "svo8011_009": "Besides, the principles were the same as GGO:\r\nShoot to kill!",
    "svo8011_010": "Y-Yeah, I guess...",
    "svo8011_011": "Oh hey, that reminds me, don't you play with a girl avatar in GGO?\r\nA Type F, I mean?",
    "svo8011_012": "Ugh...",
    "svo8011_013": "Why did you pick a female avatar anyway?\r\nAs far as I can see, you're using a male avatar now.\r\nOh, and don't think you can worm your way out of the question this time.",
    "svo8011_014": "W-Well, uh...",
    "svo8011_015": "Wait a second...\r\nIs this avatar a girl that happens to look male?",
    "svo8011_016": "Now that I think about it, I guess it is kinda on the slender side.\r\nCan't believe I never noticed. Mind if I take a closer look?",
    "svo8011_017": "H-Hey, no, stop! Aaaaah!",
    "svo8011_018": "Hmm, I dunno. Sure, you're slender around here,\r\nbut your avatar looks like it's male from what I can tell.",
    "svo8011_019": "H-Hey! Don't touch me there!",
    "svo8011_020": "But I need to take a look at it or I'll never know!",
    "svo8011_021": "No, not there! Anywhere but there!",
    "svo8011_022": "Mgh, you're such a Scrooge. Fine, how about here?\r\nAha... Well, what do you know?",
    "svo8011_023": "Agh, stop, that tickles! LLENN, no!",
    "svo8011_024": "Ohh? Is this your weak point I've found?\r\nHeheheh! I'm gonna get ya!",
    "svo8011_025": "Let me go! Hands off, please!",
    "svo8011_026": "Enough already! My avatar is Type M! Male!",
    "svo8011_027": "Huh? Oh, uh... sorry?",
    "svo8011_028": "It's fine as long as we're clear.",
    "svo8011_029": "And while we're at it, my GGO avatar is male, too.",
    "svo8011_030": "I just happened to end up with a rare avatar which looked like a girl.",
    "svo8011_031": "Wait, seriously? I never knew there was an avatar like that.",
    "svo8011_032": "Then again, me and Fuka got tiny and adorable ones,\r\nso I guess it's not all that surprising when you think about it.",
    "svo8011_033": "Yeah, there's a variety of appearances,\r\nbut your gender is always the same as your IRL self.",
    "svo8011_034": "Wow, so you really did simply end up with a super cute male avatar.\r\nFascinating!",
    "svo8011_035": "I bet Fuka'd get a kick outta that. I gotta tell her!",
    "svo8011_036": "W-Wait! You can't let anyone know!",
    "svo8011_037": "Huh? Why not?\r\nIt's not every day you find yourself with such an ultra adorable avatar.",
    "svo8011_038": "Well, it's kinda embarrassing, that's why.\r\nI'd rather this got out to as few people as possible.",
    "svo8011_039": "Hmmm...",
    "svo8011_040": "Tell you what, I'll zip the lip if you tell me\r\na good place to go grinding. Deal?",
    "svo8011_041": "Sure, piece of cake.\r\nIn fact, I'll even go with you myself if you'd like.",
    "svo8011_042": "Awesome! Can't wait!",
    "svo8011_043": "Oh, by the way, why don't you try out ALO with me sometime?\r\nI'm sure you'd do great there with how good you are with LLENN.",
    "svo8011_044": "Oh, uh, ALO is, er...",
    "svo8011_045": "Plus, you'll keep your stats as LLENN if you convert your character,\r\nso you could keep using the AGI build you currently have.",
    "svo8011_046": "B-But I'd look a lot different, wouldn't I?",
    "svo8011_047": "Now that you mention it,\r\nI guess it would be pretty hard to get around ALO at that size.",
    "svo8011_048": "Personally, though, I'm curious to see what kind of avatar one as tiny as yours\r\nwould become there.",
    "svo8011_049": "Ugh...",
    "svo8011_050": "LLENN? What's wrong?",
    "svo8011_051": "Oh, nothing, just dealing with some old trauma, that's all.\r\nLook, let's put this whole thing aside for now.",
    "svo8011_052": "I like LLENN best as she is now. Small.\r\nSo I think I'll stick with GGO.",
    "svo8011_053": "Yeah, I see what you mean. Your playstyle could be considerably altered if the\r\nnew avatar turns out too different. Might be best if you stick to what you're\r\nused to.",
    "svo8011_054": "Yeah, exactly! Why fix what ain't broke?!",
    "svo8011_055": "Still, thanks for the invite, Kirito. I really appreciate it!",
    "svo8011_056": "I have the most fun when I'm playing with others like you.",
    "svo8011_057": "Not only are you reliable to a fault, but you're a really good team player, too!\r\nLong time vets like you really are on a whole different level.",
    "svo8011_058": "Haha, that sentiment's clichéd, but I'm grateful for it all the same.",
    "svo8011_059": "Anyway, what say we go paint the town, or at least the battlefields, red.",
    "svo8011_060": "Sounds great. You know, talking with you got me all motivated.\r\nLet's hit the road then, shall we?",
    "svo8011_061": "Awright, then let's go make some monsters sorry they were ever born!",
    "svo8012_001": "Hey there, Kirito! How's it hanging? You still holding up?",
    "svo8012_002": "Oh, Fukaziroh. Yeah, I'm good, thanks for asking.",
    "svo8012_003": "Great, glad to hear it! It's good to feel good!",
    "svo8012_004": "Uh, yeah I guess so. You're energetic as per usual.\r\nYou're bouncing around like you're having the time of your life.",
    "svo8012_005": "Ah, that's just how I am. People say I'm too hyper for my own good.",
    "svo8012_006": "Still, you're not wrong about me having the time of my life.",
    "svo8012_007": "How could I not, after that awesome journey we got through!\r\nSure, it was pretty hectic, but still!",
    "svo8012_008": "Good to know. I was worried you might be having it rough from how different this\r\nall is from GGO.",
    "svo8012_009": "I mean, I'd be lying if I said it was easy.\r\nI sure wasn't used to that sense of being in grave danger all the time!",
    "svo8012_010": "But the teamwork and gameplay was so hype! It was like, being a regular...\r\nWell, a normie, sort of.",
    "svo8012_011": "Uh... r-really?",
    "svo8012_012": "Why so skeptical?! You're the one who was at the heart of it all!",
    "svo8012_013": "Are you one of those people who's got a magnetic personality?\r\nOh, or maybe you're on your New Game Plus of life?",
    "svo8012_014": "No, it's nothing like that, really...",
    "svo8012_015": "All that aside, though, I'm sure our bond's stronger than ever before\r\nnow that we've gotten through such harsh trials together!",
    "svo8012_016": "Well, when you put it like that, yeah,\r\nI do feel like I know you better than I did thanks to all this.",
    "svo8012_017": "I know, right?! I'm never wrong!",
    "svo8012_018": "Which is why I'm here thinking this is the part where I give you a symbol\r\nof our bond or something.",
    "svo8012_019": "I-I don't know if I'd go that far...",
    "svo8012_020": "C'mon, no need to be shy! Think of it as a symbol of our bond from yours truly!\r\nNow listen up and listen good!",
    "svo8012_021": "O-Okay, okay...",
    "svo8012_022": "Well first, you know how my adorable little grenade launchers\r\nare called Rightony and Leftania, yeah?",
    "svo8012_023": "Oh yeah, now that you mention it. In hindsight, those names are so you.\r\nNice and simple to remember.",
    "svo8012_024": "Totally! Even I know how good those names are if I do say so myself!",
    "svo8012_025": "Anywho, to preserve the tradition, I'm gonna dub your right-handed sword\r\n\"Rightania\" and your left-handed sword \"Leftony.\" Whaddya think?",
    "svo8012_026": "...",
    "svo8012_027": "Rightania and Leftony! C'mon, repeat after me!",
    "svo8012_028": "Rightania and Leftony...",
    "svo8012_029": "L-Listen, I, uh... ahaha...",
    "svo8012_030": "Hey now, what's with the awkward laugh?\r\nAin't you the one who said those names were nice and easy to remember?",
    "svo8012_031": "Y-Yeah, and I appreciate the gesture, it's just, well...\r\nHow do I put this?",
    "svo8012_032": "C'mon, don't be shy!",
    "svo8012_033": "(What do I do?! Their names really are going to end up as Rightania and Leftony\r\nunless I say something!)",
    "svo8012_034": "N-No, it's, well...",
    "svo8012_035": "M-My swords already have names, you see. So while I think those are nice names,\r\nI don't know how I'd feel about changing their names after so long...",
    "svo8012_036": "Ah, fair point. Guess you don't need any new names for 'em, then!",
    "svo8012_037": "Still, this means I gotta think of something else to serve\r\nas the symbol of our bond. Hmm...",
    "svo8012_038": "If you want to do something for me,\r\nthen why not tell me about your friends in GGO?",
    "svo8012_039": "They all sound like a colorful bunch.",
    "svo8012_040": "Really? That's good enough for you?\r\nOkay then, lemme give you the lowdown!",
    "svo8012_041": "Thanks.",
    "svo8012_042": "But... Hmm, where to start...",
    "svo8012_043": "Maybe the best weapons collector in GGO?\r\nWho's also a blood knight and loves battles to the death?!",
    "svo8012_044": "Uh, did you say something about battles to the death?",
    "svo8012_045": "Oh yeah, but I only meant in-game, of course!\r\nY'know, since it's all about \"kill or be killed\" in there!",
    "svo8012_046": "Then again, I'd bet she'd do the same IRL too. She's a crazy one...",
    "svo8012_047": "She, um... She sounds like a character, that's for sure.",
    "svo8012_048": "What, you think that's it?! I'm only getting started!",
    "svo8012_049": "I haven't even told you about the masochist that hangs out with her that loves\r\nit when she tries to kill him!",
    "svo8012_050": "Still, he's pretty good at what he does.\r\nYou know how GGO uses bullet circles to help you with aiming?",
    "svo8012_051": "Well, he's got the IRL skills to hit the bullseye without even using those!",
    "svo8012_052": "That's, uh... that sure is something.",
    "svo8012_053": "Huh? You don't sound all that impressed.",
    "svo8012_054": "No, it's cool how his IRL skills translate to games, it's just, well,\r\nI'm still kinda hung up on the part you mentioned before any of that...",
    "svo8012_055": "Oh? Well, if that doesn't tickle your fancy, then how about this?",
    "svo8012_056": "GGO's got these top-class teams made up entirely of girls!\r\nIsn't that cool?!",
    "svo8012_057": "Wow, that's definitely not something you see every day, is it?\r\nConsidering what a violent world GGO is, I mean.",
    "svo8012_058": "You're telling me! Oh, but they're all in tune with the way things work in GGO\r\nand all. They're known as the Amazons of the world of firearms!",
    "svo8012_059": "All of them stronger and more murderous than you!\r\nOne wrong look and they might kill without a moments thought.",
    "svo8012_060": "I see...",
    "svo8012_061": "(Why are all of her friends so peculiar?)",
    "svo8012_062": "Well, if nothing else, I've learned that GGO attracts far more unique customers\r\nthan myself.",
    "svo8012_063": "Now that you mention it, I've been thinking,\r\nshouldn't hardcore gamers like you have more of an edge?",
    "svo8012_064": "Yep, I've decided! I'll help you craft a new and improved Kirito.\r\nOne that nobody will be able to forget!",
    "svo8012_065": "No thanks, I'm fine! I'd rather stay normal!",
    "svo8012_066": "Oh! Unless you've got a really intense side I haven't stumbled across yet.",
    "svo8012_067": "I've nothing of the sort!",
    "svo8012_068": "A-Anyway, if nothing else, it seems like you have a great bunch of friends.",
    "svo8012_069": "You betcha! They always keep me laughing,\r\nand there's more people to share the bloodlust with!",
    "svo8012_070": "(What did she say? Did she say bloodlust?)",
    "svo8012_071": "No need to be jealous, though!\r\nYou and your friends are a blast, too!",
    "svo8012_072": "Oh, I'm glad to hear that.",
    "svo8012_073": "I'm sure that goes without saying.\r\nI mean we've been having an awesome time, right?",
    "svo8012_074": "Hehe, right. Hanging out with you has been great!",
    "svo8012_075": "Well, shall we keep the fun going, Fukaziroh?",
    "svo8013_001": "...",
    "svo8013_002": "What's wrong, Alice? You look a little down.",
    "svo8013_003": "Oh, Kirito. Hello.",
    "svo8013_004": "Hey, we're fine now.\r\nEverything worked out. Fuuka's safe and Gabriel's been obliterated.",
    "svo8013_005": "I know.\r\nAnd yet is it really over? Was that really the end of it all?",
    "svo8013_006": "During the Underworld War, Commander Bercouli risked it all to defeat\r\nEmperor Vecta. But his death wasn't permanent, and he soon came back.",
    "svo8013_007": "What's more, you defeated him once before, Kirito.\r\nAnd even then...",
    "svo8013_008": "Alice...",
    "svo8013_009": "So, is this it? Is it actually over?\r\nWas his soul finally erased from existence?",
    "svo8013_010": "I can't predict what'll happen in Galaxia or virtual worlds.\r\nSo does he have a chance of coming back? I'm not sure.",
    "svo8013_011": "I see.",
    "svo8013_012": "No problem, though.\r\nWe've beaten him a few times now, haven't we?",
    "svo8013_013": "Even if he gets stronger, we'll get stronger, too.\r\nDon't worry about it.",
    "svo8013_014": "Kirito...",
    "svo8013_015": "You're right.\r\nIf we know danger's coming, we need only be ready.",
    "svo8013_016": "If fear kept you from planting the seed, you'd never see the flower bloom.\r\nSomething like that, right?",
    "svo8013_017": "Exactly. We can't live scared.\r\nIt's important to move forward.",
    "svo8013_018": "I agree. I, too, shall move forward. By your side.",
    "svo8013_019": "Speaking of, it was a pleasure fighting beside you this time.",
    "svo8013_020": "This time?",
    "svo8013_021": "At the end of the Underworld War, I was unable to join you in battle.\r\nBut this time, I stood beside you when it mattered most.",
    "svo8013_022": "And I couldn't be happier.",
    "svo8013_023": "I'm glad you could be there, too.\r\nIt was reassuring to have you there.",
    "svo8013_024": "Do you mean that?!",
    "svo8013_025": "Of course! I'll always be grateful when you're around.",
    "svo8013_026": "When I was in Underworld, you were by me the whole time\r\nI was in such a sad state. If it weren't for you, I might not be here now.",
    "svo8013_027": "Thank you so much, Alice.",
    "svo8013_028": "Oh, that was—",
    "svo8013_029": "I mean, you're welcome, Kirito.",
    "svo8013_030": "Granted, I don't think I could've beaten Gabriel on my own this time.\r\nWe won thanks to you and the others.\r\nThat's why I'm sure we'll be all right next time, too.",
    "svo8013_031": "Then, would you—\r\nWould you have me stay with you? Is that what you wish?",
    "svo8013_032": "Wha—? Uh, yeah.",
    "svo8013_033": "...",
    "svo8013_034": "I want you right beside me. That's what I want.",
    "svo8013_035": "Understood. So it shall be.",
    "svo8013_036": "From here on out, wherever you go, Alice Synthesis Thirty goes, too.",
    "svo8014_001": "It's been a good while since we last got to take it easy and talk like this,\r\nhasn't it?",
    "svo8014_002": "I guess so. Maybe since our time at the Swordcraft Academy?",
    "svo8014_003": "Sounds about right. That feels like it was just the other day,\r\nbut also ages ago. What a strange feeling.",
    "svo8014_004": "Yeah.",
    "svo8014_005": "Hey, Kirito, do you remember when we first met?",
    "svo8014_006": "'Course I do! Couldn't forget it if I wanted to.",
    "svo8014_007": "I was chopping away at the Gigas Cedar, and you came out of nowhere.\r\nYou really made me jump.",
    "svo8014_008": "I was just as surprised,\r\nseeing you trying to cut down that massive tree alone.",
    "svo8014_009": "That was my Calling back then.\r\nBut right after that, we went to the End Mountains, and then Zakkaria.",
    "svo8014_010": "And we took the swordcraft test and entered the academy.\r\nThinking back on it, we've been through a lot.",
    "svo8014_011": "But why the sudden nostalgia?",
    "svo8014_012": "You're not quite old enough for that sort of reminiscing.",
    "svo8014_013": "Haha, yeah. Wonder where that came from.\r\nI guess something about now reminds me of then.",
    "svo8014_014": "Like what?",
    "svo8014_015": "Since we got here, we've been to different worlds and met all kinds of people.\r\nWe've had to fight some, but we've also made a lot of friends.",
    "svo8014_016": "And we've been together the whole while.",
    "svo8014_017": "Eugeo...",
    "svo8014_018": "I'm not sure if it's entirely appropriate to call it fun,\r\nbut I did enjoy myself.",
    "svo8014_019": "Me, too. It was definitely fun fighting together with you.",
    "svo8014_020": "For sure.",
    "svo8014_021": "And the beasts they have here are something else.\r\nLike that enormous thing underwater, the uh—",
    "svo8014_022": "The Kraken? Yeah, that was a bit shocking.",
    "svo8014_023": "Even the dragons the Integrity Knights ride aren't that big.\r\nEveryone's weapons are so unique, too.",
    "svo8014_024": "Ah, yeah, the guns Sinon, LLENN, and company are using, right?\r\nThere weren't any firearms back in our old stomping grounds.",
    "svo8014_025": "It's been thrilling getting to see so many different things.\r\nAlthough, I have mixed feelings about Administrator joining us.",
    "svo8014_026": "She was on our side with a couple other people\r\nI wouldn't exactly call friends.",
    "svo8014_027": "Yeah, that's exactly it, Kirito. That worries me.",
    "svo8014_028": "What does?",
    "svo8014_029": "I know you have a lot of friends and they're all great, trustworthy people.",
    "svo8014_030": "But there are about as many people who might not have the best intentions,\r\nright? It's not just Administrator, but Death Gun and Oberon...",
    "svo8014_031": "I can't argue with that.",
    "svo8014_032": "I bet you've been as reckless as ever, just like at the academy.",
    "svo8014_033": "Hey, it's true some people had it in for me,\r\nbut it's not like that was my fault exactly.",
    "svo8014_034": "You can be so rash when I'm not there to put the brakes on.\r\nSeriously, what am I going to do with you?",
    "svo8014_035": "Hey, I'm not some little kid.\r\nI do fine on my own, thank you very much.",
    "svo8014_036": "I wonder. That's the part of you I question.",
    "svo8014_037": "Well, you're way too careful.\r\nAt least, give me some credit for being courageous.",
    "svo8014_038": "How about foolhardy? I don't think courageous is how I'd describe\r\njumping out a window to go buy honey pies.",
    "svo8014_039": "As if you didn't help yourself to those pies every time!",
    "svo8014_040": "I did it to help you. It's not good to overeat, you know.",
    "svo8014_041": "Pfft! Heh heh.",
    "svo8014_042": "Haha!",
    "svo8014_043": "Well, anyway, let's get back to the others.\r\nI think the party will be starting soon.",
    "svo8014_044": "Oh, right.",
    "svo8015_001": "I was looking for you, Heathcliff.",
    "svo8015_002": "Hello, Kirito.\r\nI must say, I'm a little surprised you'd go out of your way to speak with me.",
    "svo8015_003": "So, what can I do for you?",
    "svo8015_004": "I figured I should thank you. You did your part to help sort things out.\r\nAt least for now.",
    "svo8015_005": "For now, is it? I suppose you're right.",
    "svo8015_006": "I require no thanks, however.\r\nThis has been an opportunity to observe something quite fascinating.",
    "svo8015_007": "I was just pondering on it, in fact.",
    "svo8015_008": "Something caught your interest?\r\nDo you mean the thing with Fuuka and Neige?",
    "svo8015_009": "Them and the phenomenon involving them, yes.\r\nNeige's expansion of her permissions is particularly interesting.",
    "svo8015_010": "Summoning someone to this world across space and time is impossible\r\ngiven our current technology.\r\nIt shouldn't be a matter of exercising certain \"permissions.\"",
    "svo8015_011": "I'm not that familiar with Underworld, but judging by Quinella's reaction,\r\nit probably wouldn't be possible even with Sacred Arts.",
    "svo8015_012": "I don't think I can explain it, either.\r\nBut how did we get here?",
    "svo8015_013": "That's what's fascinating! I've deduced a possible explanation\r\nbut have far too little material with which to verify it.",
    "svo8015_014": "Wait, you're telling me you know how it all worked?!",
    "svo8015_015": "It isn't the sort of theory I'd present proudly.\r\nAs I said, there's still too little to go on.",
    "svo8015_016": "However, I can sum it up. So, this should be impossible with our technology,\r\nas well as that of Underworld's.",
    "svo8015_017": "It's possible the technology is not from our time. They could have used\r\na technology from the future. From beyond our cutting-edge tech.",
    "svo8015_018": "Beyond our—\r\nHeathcliff, you're not being serious right now, are you?",
    "svo8015_019": "...",
    "svo8015_020": "Haha! You had me for a second there.\r\nI didn't expect you to joke around like that.",
    "svo8015_021": "Whatever the truth may be, the system exists,\r\nso I'm quite interested in uncovering its workings.",
    "svo8015_022": "You are a researcher at heart.",
    "svo8015_023": "I am. But wouldn't you say part of the fun of being a player\r\nis trying to discover the developer's intentions?",
    "svo8015_024": "If someone did indeed come from the future, what caused them to do so?\r\nAnd what phenomena result from them being here?",
    "svo8015_025": "Isn't it interesting getting to the bottom of such things?",
    "svo8015_026": "We could do worse than enjoy the game as players\r\nwhile we're here in this world.",
    "svo8015_027": "Don't they say there's nothing more boring\r\nthan watching an RPG someone else is playing?",
    "svo8015_028": "I suppose there's some truth in that.",
    "svo8015_029": "I'm going to investigate this world a tad more. What will you do?",
    "svo8015_030": "I'll tag along. You're too dangerous to leave on your own.",
    "svo8016_001": "Phew. That oughta do it.",
    "svo8016_002": "Not the worst results, I guess. Now, let me—",
    "svo8016_003": "Oh! Crap!",
    "svo8016_004": "...",
    "svo8016_005": "Come out. I know you're there.",
    "svo8016_006": "...",
    "svo8016_007": "What's your deal?",
    "svo8016_008": "Pathetic how you let that enemy get the drop on you.",
    "svo8016_009": "You've lost your edge.",
    "svo8016_010": "It's true it caught me off-guard, but I could've handled it.\r\nStill, thanks for the assist.",
    "svo8016_011": "So what's this all about? You followed me here, didn't you?",
    "svo8016_012": "Oh, you noticed? Well, you're not entirely pitiful.",
    "svo8016_013": "What are you trying to say?",
    "svo8016_014": "It's just us right now.",
    "svo8016_015": "Won't you turn your sword on me?",
    "svo8016_016": "...",
    "svo8016_017": "Not this time.",
    "svo8016_018": "I knew it. You've let yourself turn to rust.",
    "svo8016_019": "I have not.\r\nThere's just no need for me to stab you right now.",
    "svo8016_020": "Besides, you actually helped us.\r\nNo point in fighting over nothing.",
    "svo8016_021": "You've grown soft. Your will to fight has withered.",
    "svo8016_022": "You're one to talk.",
    "svo8016_023": "What do you mean?",
    "svo8016_024": "When you fired earlier.\r\nShouldn't you have aimed at me and not the monster?",
    "svo8016_025": "You had an opening when I was attacked.\r\nIf you'd played your cards right, you could've taken both me and the enemy down.",
    "svo8016_026": "Knowing you, you must've thought about it.",
    "svo8016_027": "...",
    "svo8016_028": "Weren't you going to kill me?",
    "svo8016_029": "That's right. One day I will.",
    "svo8016_030": "But seeing some weak mob injure you fills me with woe.",
    "svo8016_031": "There's no point killing you in this pitiable state.",
    "svo8016_032": "Ugh, just let it go.",
    "svo8016_033": "What's your endgame? Are you just gonna follow me around forever?",
    "svo8016_034": "Or do you wanna party up so you can save me from getting hurt by monsters?",
    "svo8016_035": "...",
    "svo8016_036": "First, I kill you.",
    "svo8016_037": "After, I'll find new prey.",
    "svo8016_038": "I've a lot of options among your friends.",
    "svo8016_039": "Death Gun. If you do anything to them—",
    "svo8016_040": "Then don't stop training for the day you kill me.",
    "svo8016_041": "If you die before I can kill you, that would be unacceptable.",
    "svo8016_042": "And if you die too easy, that would also be unacceptable.",
    "svo8016_043": "Only I get to kill you.",
    "svo8016_044": "You're welcome to try.",
    "svo8016_045": "Oh, I will. Be afraid. Live in fear.",
    "svo8016_046": "Or at least, remember how to fight.",
    "svo8016_047": "...",
    "svo8017_001": "Thanks for listening to my song, everyone!",
    "svo8017_002": "Kirito!",
    "svo8017_003": "You did great, Yuna!",
    "svo8017_004": "Everyone had a blast. Your singing's out of this world!",
    "svo8017_005": "Hee hee! I'm glad you think so.\r\nI wish everyone could always hear my songs in person.",
    "svo8017_006": "Hey, Kirito? I've noticed something.",
    "svo8017_007": "What's that?",
    "svo8017_008": "It's true I absolutely love singing for a large crowd on stage.",
    "svo8017_009": "But I also really love singing to just my best friends.",
    "svo8017_010": "Cool! I'm happy to know you feel that way about us.",
    "svo8017_011": "Well, you've brought me so much joy!",
    "svo8017_012": "I've met so many people, and my heart feels so full.\r\nThat's thanks to you.",
    "svo8017_013": "And so...",
    "svo8017_014": "Hmm.",
    "svo8017_015": "Uh, Yuna?",
    "svo8017_016": "It's just that you always have a crowd around you.",
    "svo8017_017": "I think there must be something special about you.",
    "svo8017_018": "I was trying to see if I could locate it.",
    "svo8017_019": "Is that even something you can find from looking at me?",
    "svo8017_020": "Hee hee! Well, I couldn't find it!",
    "svo8017_021": "I really don't think there's anything particularly special about me.",
    "svo8017_022": "I dunno. Look at all the people you've brought together.\r\nThat means there must be!",
    "svo8017_023": "Kirito, you really draw people in.\r\nYou might have what it takes to be a pop star.",
    "svo8017_024": "Oh, no, no, no! There's no way I'm cut out for that!",
    "svo8017_025": "Why not? You won't know if you don't try!",
    "svo8017_026": "I know! Why don't you sing on stage with me next time?\r\nEveryone would love it!",
    "svo8017_027": "I couldn't compete with you!",
    "svo8017_028": "Really? Well, it doesn't need to be a competition.\r\nWe can both be superstars!",
    "svo8017_029": "I mean, I'm too shy to perform like you.\r\nI'm not sure I'd be up to the challenge.",
    "svo8017_030": "What? For real?",
    "svo8017_031": "Yeah, I think stage fright might stop me before I start.",
    "svo8017_032": "Well, maybe someday you'll feel different. Too bad, though.\r\nIt would be a blast.",
    "svo8017_033": "Sorry. I hate to turn you down.",
    "svo8017_034": "No biggie. I just thought it could be neat.",
    "svo8017_035": "Besides, as long as I'm with you, we're bound to have oodles of fun, right?",
    "svo8017_036": "Yeah! That I can try to make happen!",
    "svo8017_037": "And I love your songs, so I hope I get to keep hearing you sing.",
    "svo8017_038": "Aw, that's sweet! I'm super happy now.",
    "svo8017_039": "Kirito, I hope you'll always be in earshot when I sing!",
    "svo8018_001": "Eiji, there you are. Been looking for you.",
    "svo8018_002": "Kirito? You need me for something?",
    "svo8018_003": "I just wanted to properly thank you for everything.\r\nYou've helped so much.",
    "svo8018_004": "Please. I didn't do anything worth special attention.",
    "svo8018_005": "Besides, you saved me, too. One hand washes the other.",
    "svo8018_006": "When did that happen? Oh, the cognitive contamination thing?",
    "svo8018_007": "Yeah. The world of my memories of SAO.\r\nWhen I was still Nautilus.",
    "svo8018_008": "Those memories deeply seared into my brain is why that world\r\nwas even reproduced at all.",
    "svo8018_009": "A part of me must still desperately want to do it over if only I could.\r\nYou made me face what was inside me.",
    "svo8018_010": "Eiji...",
    "svo8018_011": "Don't gimme that look.\r\nSure, maybe I can't forget it, but I've made my peace, more or less.",
    "svo8018_012": "The past can't be undone. Those who died don't return.\r\nI know these things as sure as anyone. I know you get that.",
    "svo8018_013": "So, looking at it now, even if I'd stayed unaware,\r\nit would've been terrible for me to remain in that place.",
    "svo8018_014": "Thank you for freeing me.\r\nThat's why I owe you my thanks, too.",
    "svo8018_015": "...",
    "svo8018_016": "You know, Eiji.\r\nI also have a wound in my heart from SAO that'll never heal.",
    "svo8018_017": "You do?",
    "svo8018_018": "So even the Black Swordsman shares something of that past.\r\nWeren't you famous for being aloof and all that?",
    "svo8018_019": "Though, I guess you weren't always on your own.\r\nIt seems you had more than a few allies. Same as now.",
    "svo8018_020": "You're right. It's true I gained a lot of things from SAO.\r\nFriends were one of the best.",
    "svo8018_021": "But I lost a lot of things, as well.",
    "svo8018_022": "...",
    "svo8018_023": "A lot of people were hurt in the incident.\r\nAnd they still suffer, even now. Just like you.",
    "svo8018_024": "I honestly thought you'd gotten over that long ago.\r\nI figured you'd practically forgotten it.",
    "svo8018_025": "You seem to be living it up in VRMMO despite SAO.",
    "svo8018_026": "I think the reason I can enjoy life now is probably\r\nbecause Asuna was there for me.",
    "svo8018_027": "So, it's thanks to her?",
    "svo8018_028": "I owe her, too.\r\nWhen things went down this time, she helped me regain my composure.",
    "svo8018_029": "The Asuna I know was hard on herself and others,\r\nbut she was really sincere at the same time.",
    "svo8018_030": "I can see how being with someone like that would make you feel differently.",
    "svo8018_031": "Definitely. Meeting her played a big part in who and where I am today.\r\nHonestly, I think I was just lucky.",
    "svo8018_032": "Nah. It wasn't luck. It's because you're you.",
    "svo8018_033": "Asuna chose to be with you precisely because of who you are.\r\nYou can't help creating bonds wherever you go.",
    "svo8018_034": "I do that? What makes you say—",
    "svo8018_035": "I'm breaking it down based on the facts I have.\r\nWeren't you just talking about all your friends and allies?",
    "svo8018_036": "And I should add it wasn't just allies that were there this time.\r\nYou even included former enemies in your circle.",
    "svo8018_037": "And you were at the center of all this. That's not luck.\r\nThat's your nature.",
    "svo8018_038": "Wait a minute!\r\nIf you put it that way, it paints me as some kind of miracle worker.",
    "svo8018_039": "Do you deny it? Too much modesty is as irritating as too little.",
    "svo8018_040": "I accept what you're saying, but I just don't really get why it happens.\r\nI can't wrap my head around it.",
    "svo8018_041": "Probably has to do with how easy you are to talk to.",
    "svo8018_042": "I've been spilling my guts for minutes now.",
    "svo8018_043": "Eiji!",
    "svo8018_044": "What?",
    "svo8018_045": "I didn't know you thought about me like that. Thanks.",
    "svo8018_046": "Uh, I think you missed my point, but you're welcome.",
    "svo8018_047": "Simply put, you're a nosy guy who can't help\r\nbut barge right into people's hearts, muddy boots and all.",
    "svo8018_048": "Haha! Okay, well, I get your point there.",
    "svo8018_049": "But you know, I'm happy you opened up to me.",
    "svo8018_050": "N-No, see I...\r\nYou keep putting a weird twist on what I'm trying to say.",
    "svo8018_051": "Agh, I'm done! This conversation's over! I'm outta here!",
    "svo8018_052": "What? Aw, come on, let's chat a little more.\r\nIt was going so well.",
    "svo8018_053": "I said I'm done! Let me stalk off in style!",
    "svo8018_054": "Aw, come on now, don't be like that.\r\nTell me more about you.",
    "svo8019_001": "Sugou.",
    "svo8019_002": "You? What business could you possibly have with me?",
    "svo8019_003": "The situation has been resolved.\r\nI believe we have nothing left to discuss.",
    "svo8019_004": "I figured I should show some gratitude given everything that happened.",
    "svo8019_005": "Hmph. You certainly have a lot of time on your hands.",
    "svo8019_006": "Unfortunately, I do not, and I've precious little time to waste exchanging\r\nworthless pleasantries with you.",
    "svo8019_007": "Hey, it's not like I'm here because I have nothing else to do.\r\nBut I thought I should at least be civil. Even if you're you.",
    "svo8019_008": "Well, you are persistent. But to spare myself the prolonging of this encounter,\r\nsay what you've come to say.",
    "svo8019_009": "Don't mind if I do!",
    "svo8019_010": "Sugou, your cooperation was helpful!\r\nThanks for lending us a hand, okay?",
    "svo8019_011": "Ha! Thanks, he says.\r\nYou're several magnitudes of kindhearted above what I expected.",
    "svo8019_012": "And you are under a misconception here.\r\nThe actions I took were not for your benefit.",
    "svo8019_013": "Oh, yeah?",
    "svo8019_014": "I couldn't leave things to you and risk the worst happening.\r\nWith the situation on a knife's edge, I wasn't about to let you get us killed.",
    "svo8019_015": "And that's not all! While I am brilliant on my own,\r\nI needed other hands which I could direct to succeed.",
    "svo8019_016": "Accompanying you was a necessity I accepted.",
    "svo8019_017": "You don't say.",
    "svo8019_018": "Well, the fact remains you lent us a hand.\r\nI feel like you did enough to warrant me saying thank you.",
    "svo8019_019": "Hmph. Were that an apology, I'd gladly accept it.\r\nCooperating with misfits like you and yours was exceedingly stressful.",
    "svo8019_020": "You know it wouldn't kill you to learn to be a little nicer.\r\nThough, I guess it's true many of us are kinda outside the norm.",
    "svo8019_021": "Do you truly not see it? You are abnormal!",
    "svo8019_022": "The desire you all have to battle the cruelties of reality\r\nwith nary a hint of hesitation is stupefying.",
    "svo8019_023": "And with not a moment to consider your own safety.\r\nNo normal person behaves so rashly.",
    "svo8019_024": "Well, we knew Gabriel had to be stopped.\r\nWe were out of options.",
    "svo8019_025": "That's your explanation? Desperation?\r\nAll I see is a bizarre lack of entirely appropriate fear.",
    "svo8019_026": "That couldn't be further from the truth.\r\nBut nothing would change if we just stood around doing nothing.",
    "svo8019_027": "*sigh* Shoot first and weigh danger later? Action is the only course?\r\nIs that what you're trying to say?",
    "svo8019_028": "Yeah, something like that.",
    "svo8019_029": "Hmph! You're infuriating. That's just the thing the incompetent\r\nuse to justify themselves. I can neither comprehend nor condone it.",
    "svo8019_030": "But you knew how dangerous it was and you still came along, didn't you?",
    "svo8019_031": "Do not lump me in with your motley crew.\r\nI only ever act based on rational, composed thought.",
    "svo8019_032": "Got it. Well, at least accept my gratitude for what it is.",
    "svo8019_033": "Ugh. Fine.",
    "svo8019_034": "Though, come to think of it, I must also voice my gratefulness.",
    "svo8019_035": "Uh, what for?",
    "svo8019_036": "As a seeker of knowledge,\r\nI must say this incident was an extremely fascinating case study.",
    "svo8019_037": "It was an experience I would not at all like to revisit, thank you very much.\r\nHowever, it was nevertheless a valuable one.",
    "svo8019_038": "Indeed, from now on I will be making good use of the knowledge I gained.\r\nYou do not object to that, do you, Kirito?",
    "svo8019_039": "To you gaining knowledge? No.",
    "svo8019_040": "But if you try to use it to do anything shifty,\r\nI'll nip that in the bud and quick.",
    "svo8019_041": "Hahaha! Quite confident, aren't you? What a puffed chest.",
    "svo8019_042": "But do you really think it'll go so well every time?\r\nIs your confidence not misplaced?",
    "svo8019_043": "Well, I... Hmm.",
    "svo8019_044": "To be honest, you tend to trip over your own feet at the fatal moment.",
    "svo8019_045": "Even if you tried something, you'd be up against everyone who helped out,\r\nand as soon as someone saw you, you'd be toast.",
    "svo8019_046": "...",
    "svo8019_047": "Hah!",
    "svo8019_048": "Y-You!",
    "svo8019_049": "Y-You underestimate me!\r\nHow dare you think you can talk to me that way!",
    "svo8019_050": "No, I mean, I'm not making light of you or anything.\r\nI can be a bit blunt sometimes!",
    "svo8019_051": "Do not mock me!\r\nI am an outstanding researcher despite what you may believe!",
    "svo8019_052": "Ah, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!",
    "svo8019_053": "Well, anywho, I've said my thanks. I'll be going now.",
    "svo8019_054": "Hey, you wait right there! I'm not through talking to you!",
    "svo8019_055": "Didn't you say you were busy?\r\nThanks for taking the time to humor me! Later!",
    "svo8019_056": "Why you! Do you intend to say your piece and go?!\r\nHey! Stop! Wait just a minute!",
    "svo8020_001": "There you are.\r\nYou sure seem to be taking in all the sights, Administrator.",
    "svo8020_002": "And you, little boy, sure seem to be terribly interested in me.\r\nWhy have you gone through the effort to track me down?",
    "svo8020_003": "What? I wouldn't say I was looking for you, exactly.",
    "svo8020_004": "You appear to be adept at cajoling women. Have you set your sights on me now?\r\nWhat do they say in the Sacred Tongue? I am your \"target\"?",
    "svo8020_005": "What the heck are you talking about?!\r\nAs if that would ever be the case!",
    "svo8020_006": "Not to mention, most of the women around me are either family or friends!",
    "svo8020_007": "Now, no need to make excuses.\r\nBesides, it isn't my intention to be critical of you.",
    "svo8020_008": "In fact, you should be proud of yourself.\r\nYou've gathered many an attendant without any coercion.",
    "svo8020_009": "Attendant? Listen—",
    "svo8020_010": "Your strengths are admirable.\r\nIt's understandable that many might fall into your thrall.",
    "svo8020_011": "You've got it all wrong.\r\nThose people aren't my attendants or anything like that.",
    "svo8020_012": "And there's no enthralling anyone with my power going on, either.\r\nThey're all friends who I have a strong bond with.",
    "svo8020_013": "Heh heh. Well, I won't belabor the point.",
    "svo8020_014": "And as for your first question...",
    "svo8020_015": "My what? Oh, the reason you've been poking around?",
    "svo8020_016": "This world in all its fullness will also be mine someday.\r\nWhy shouldn't I get to know it?",
    "svo8020_017": "This world may be temporary, but it's still a world.\r\nBringing peace and tranquility is my duty as an administrator.",
    "svo8020_018": "As the sole Administrator, I presume.",
    "svo8020_019": "I perused several of your worlds,\r\nbut I admit I found gun technology quite fascinating.",
    "svo8020_020": "Unlike with Sacred Arts, there is no need for innate talent.\r\nWhat's more, the damage they do is unaffected by the user.",
    "svo8020_021": "With enough people in possession of these guns,\r\nsuppressing other people or beasts would be a simple endeavor.",
    "svo8020_022": "Maybe don't say such disturbing things.\r\nEven if you're joking, I don't think anyone would find it funny.",
    "svo8020_023": "Well, I will govern in a way that things will not be disturbing.\r\nThey will be splendid.",
    "svo8020_024": "Anyway, if I could investigate that little mouse's room a bit more,\r\nit would be most helpful to me.",
    "svo8020_025": "Her room? You're not after the console Cardinal was working on, are you?\r\nAre you literally trying to gain control of this world?!",
    "svo8020_026": "Well, I've already found the key I'll need.",
    "svo8020_027": "A key?",
    "svo8020_028": "Oh, yes.",
    "svo8020_029": "Are you referring to guns? Or is it Cardinal's console?",
    "svo8020_030": "Heh heh! It's you.",
    "svo8020_031": "Huh?",
    "svo8020_032": "You yourself are the key to ruling the world.\r\nIt's become quite clear after spending all this time with you.",
    "svo8020_033": "Your ability to face a problem head-on and resolve it,\r\nand your swift and precise judgment.",
    "svo8020_034": "And your powerfully magnetic charm! Rare traits one and all.",
    "svo8020_035": "Haha! I guess you can tell jokes.",
    "svo8020_036": "Oh no, you were quite right. I'm not trying to be funny.",
    "svo8020_037": "...",
    "svo8020_038": "...",
    "svo8020_039": "No need to look at me like that.\r\nI won't be doing anything just yet.",
    "svo8020_040": "I wonder if I can believe that.",
    "svo8020_041": "It's true. Certain preparations are in order.",
    "svo8020_042": "You might not think it to look at me, but it is my diligent efforts that set me apart...or so it has been said.",
    "svo8021_001": "Kirito, Yui, tea's ready.",
    "svo8021_002": "Thanks, Mommy!",
    "svo8021_003": "It's been far too long since we've been able to enjoy your fine tea, Asuna.",
    "svo8021_004": "When not investigating, we've been fighting.\r\nThere's always something.",
    "svo8021_005": "But that's all over thanks to you, Daddy and Mommy.\r\nI knew you could do it!",
    "svo8021_006": "I guess things have settled down for now, at least.",
    "svo8021_007": "We owe a lot of thanks to everybody that helped us out.",
    "svo8021_008": "I just had the same thought. You also helped us a whole lot, Yui.",
    "svo8021_009": "Yeah! You're always a huge help, and this time you were even in the fray,\r\nfighting beside us!",
    "svo8021_010": "You played as big a role as anyone.\r\nYou've become a fine swordswoman in your own right!",
    "svo8021_011": "Me? A swordswoman? Then, I'm like you and Mommy?!",
    "svo8021_012": "Yes, you are!",
    "svo8021_013": "We're the three musketeers!",
    "svo8021_014": "That makes me so happy!\r\nI've always wanted to be able to fight together with Daddy and everybody.",
    "svo8021_015": "I couldn't do it when you had a hard time, Daddy, or when Mommy needed help,\r\nso I was super happy I could fight this time!",
    "svo8021_016": "You're wonderful, Yui!\r\nAnd you've always been there to help us.",
    "svo8021_017": "That's true! I don't know what either of us would do without you.",
    "svo8021_018": "Still, in the past it's been different.\r\nI've always wanted to fight like all of our friends.",
    "svo8021_019": "So your dream came true.",
    "svo8021_020": "It did! It really did!",
    "svo8021_021": "And it's been so long since we could all visit a world together like this.\r\nThough, it's strange being happy when everyone endured so much.",
    "svo8021_022": "Like I said, everyone worked together to make things better,\r\nand that includes you. You should be free to celebrate all you want.",
    "svo8021_023": "Okay!",
    "svo8021_024": "Come to think of it, we've been together for a really long time, haven't we?",
    "svo8021_025": "That's true. A lot's happened since we met in SAO,\r\nyet you've always been there to help us when we needed it.",
    "svo8021_026": "You've been there for me, too.\r\nI've been your daughter now for way longer than the time I spent on my own.",
    "svo8021_027": "I still remember it like yesterday.\r\nWe met at that place that you copied this log cabin from.",
    "svo8021_028": "Right. Our life as a family. It all started in that cabin.",
    "svo8021_029": "Yep. When the three of us are together,\r\nI really feel like we're at home.",
    "svo8021_030": "Given that we're in Galaxia, we should be able to do all sorts of things.\r\nWe could fish and cook just like we did back then.",
    "svo8021_031": "You're right. Floor 22's scenery is really pretty, too.\r\nIs there anything you'd like to do, Yui?",
    "svo8021_032": "Hmm.",
    "svo8021_033": "How about breakfast? Having breakfast together would be nice.",
    "svo8021_034": "Breakfast?",
    "svo8021_035": "Yeah. When I was really anxious after waking up,\r\nI had the sandwich you gave me, Mommy, and it made me feel so much better.",
    "svo8021_036": "Ooh, I remember those sandwiches! They were amazing.",
    "svo8021_037": "The sandwiches had so much mustard, I thought I'd bake you a fruit pie instead, but in the end, you wanted to eat whatever Kirito was having.",
    "svo8021_038": "He seemed to be enjoying them so much that I wanted to try one.\r\nBut pie would be lovely, too!",
    "svo8021_039": "Then, I guess I better whip one up! You guys wanna help?",
    "svo8021_040": "You know you can count on me!",
    "svo8021_041": "Of course, Mommy!",
    "svo8022_001": "...",
    "svo8022_002": "Fuuka, there you are.",
    "svo8022_003": "...",
    "svo8022_004": "Uh, Fuuka?",
    "svo8022_005": "Wha—? Oh, hi Kirito.",
    "svo8022_006": "I'm sorry. Did you come all this way to find me?",
    "svo8022_007": "Yeah. I noticed you weren't around, so I came looking.",
    "svo8022_008": "Ah, I'm sorry for the trouble.",
    "svo8022_009": "No trouble at all. I figured you might be here.",
    "svo8022_010": "I see.",
    "svo8022_011": "Ah, that's right. I wanted to thank you, Kirito.",
    "svo8022_012": "Thank you again for everything.",
    "svo8022_013": "No need to thank me. I didn't do anything all that special.",
    "svo8022_014": "Probably couldn't have done much at all if I'd been on my own.",
    "svo8022_015": "I doubt that.",
    "svo8022_016": "It was you who acknowledged the fear I felt within.\r\nWithout that, I couldn't have taken the first steps to overcome it.",
    "svo8022_017": "I see. Well, I'm glad I was able to help.\r\nI've been helped by so many in the past, it seemed the right thing to do.",
    "svo8022_018": "You have?",
    "svo8022_019": "Yep. There was a time when I was down and out.\r\nAt that time, Asuna and Eugeo and all my other friends were there for me.",
    "svo8022_020": "I envy you. You have so many close friends.",
    "svo8022_021": "Meanwhile, I...",
    "svo8022_022": "What do you mean? We're all friends now!",
    "svo8022_023": "Huh? Oh, are we? I guess so.",
    "svo8022_024": "You better believe it.\r\nWe've fought the good fight together, haven't we?",
    "svo8022_025": "True. I suppose, we really are friends.",
    "svo8022_026": "And you have one extra special friend.",
    "svo8022_027": "Do you mean Neige? But she's—",
    "svo8022_028": "Somewhere out there, I'm sure of it. You have to believe it, too.\r\nIsn't that why you're here?",
    "svo8022_029": "It is.",
    "svo8022_030": "She saved me, so I want to see her again and tell her how thankful I am.",
    "svo8022_031": "But...",
    "svo8022_032": "So long as you believe, you'll see her again someday.",
    "svo8022_033": "...",
    "svo8022_034": "The journey may be a long one, so it's natural to feel a little unsure.",
    "svo8022_035": "But if you just take it slow, day by day,\r\nI guarantee you'll get where you're going.",
    "svo8022_036": "When you put it that way,\r\nit kind of starts to feel like it could really happen.",
    "svo8022_037": "It will. You'll make it happen.\r\nAnd all of us are gonna help you however we can.",
    "svo8022_038": "Thank you, Kirito. You're right.\r\nI can't just sit here being anxious.",
    "svo8022_039": "I'm going to do all I can to see her as soon as possible!\r\nShe must be waiting for me.",
    "svo8022_040": "Yeah. Let's do it together!",
    "svo9001_001": "I must say, your guise is quite different from what it was in Underworld.",
    "svo9001_002": "Wait. I did see you in that twice when fighting.",
    "svo9001_003": "Is that what you would call your true appearance?",
    "svo9001_004": "Not exactly.\r\nBut it's the look I had when I was fighting for my life in Sword Art Online.",
    "svo9001_005": "Sword Art Online?",
    "svo9001_006": "The world's first VRMMORPG; Sword Art Online.\r\nIt was a game we were trapped in where dying meant\r\nwe would also die in the real world.",
    "svo9001_007": "A game? As in a kind of entertainment?",
    "svo9001_008": "Yeah. Normally, if you lose or die in a game, you don't die in real life.\r\nBut in Sword Art Online, you did.",
    "svo9001_009": "My life was literally on the line as I faced my opponents\r\nand tried to clear the game. That black cloak is what I wore back then.",
    "svo9001_010": "I see. That world's founder had exceedingly good taste.",
    "svo9001_011": "I guess.",
    "svo9001_012": "That was also where I met Asuna and Yui,\r\nand where I befriended Klein, Agil, Argo, Silica, and Lisbeth.",
    "svo9001_013": "I suppose it would be silly to ask if you achieved your objective,\r\nseeing as you're standing here before me.",
    "svo9001_014": "Yeah, I ultimately defeated the game's creator, \r\nAkihiko Kayaba. Or Heathcliff. And so, I beat Sword Art Online.",
    "svo9001_015": "It was some time later that you and I met.",
    "svo9001_016": "Heathcliff. So, he's the founder.\r\nHe does have a certain loftiness to him.",
    "svo9001_017": "Though I admit I did not take him for such an interesting man.",
    "svo9001_018": "Oh, he's downright ludicrous.\r\nHe joined the game as a player despite having created it.",
    "svo9001_019": "And you can't imagine how much we struggled thanks to his\r\nCardinal System's Automatic Quest Generation Function.",
    "svo9001_020": "Did you say Cardinal?",
    "svo9001_021": "Oh, uh...",
    "svo9001_022": "Well now, it seems there is a rather deep connection between that world\r\nand my Underworld. And with that Kayaba man—Heathcliff—as well.",
    "svo9002_001": "Quinella, you and Kirito met through a game, right?",
    "svo9002_002": "A game. That's right in a sense. Our battle was, in fact, enjoyable.\r\nSo, yes, a sort of game.",
    "svo9002_003": "Was it ALO?",
    "svo9002_004": "That's the world we're currently in, yes?\r\nThen, no, it wasn't.",
    "svo9002_005": "Now that you mention it,\r\nI've only been given the most cursory explanation of this world.",
    "svo9002_006": "Wait, really?! Good grief, did Kirito really forget to handle that too?",
    "svo9002_007": "Well, then I'll give you the rundown instead.\r\nThis is ALfheim Online, the world of fairies.",
    "svo9002_008": "Fairies? They have similar forms to you and Yuuki, right?",
    "svo9002_009": "Yep. Silica and Liz were there, too. Oh, and Oberon.",
    "svo9002_010": "Oberon and Kirito seemed to have quite a bit of history together.",
    "svo9002_011": "Ah, yeah. A lot of things happened back then.\r\nHe made it so Asuna was imprisoned in this world.",
    "svo9002_012": "I'm pretty sure Kirito and Asuna are over it, though.\r\nI think that's how they've managed to interact with him normally.",
    "svo9002_013": "How curious.\r\nI wouldn't have expected that Oberon fellow to do such a thing.",
    "svo9002_014": "So, how exactly was it different from that SAO world\r\nKirito and some others were in?",
    "svo9002_015": "I guess the biggest thing would be that it has magic.\r\nThat and flying.",
    "svo9002_016": "In ALO, all of the fairies have wings and can fly.",
    "svo9002_017": "I did see you and Yuuki taking to the skies. And without dragons, no less.",
    "svo9002_018": "A world in which every citizen possesses such an ability is intriguing.",
    "svo9002_019": "Did I make you curious about ALO?\r\nWe should play it together sometime!",
    "svo9002_020": "You'd get to see what Kirito and Asuna look like in it, too!",
    "svo9002_021": "I see, so you get to create a different identity in each of these worlds.",
    "svo9002_022": "My curiosity is piqued indeed.\r\nThank you for all you shared with me, Leafa.",
    "svo9003_001": "That weapon you're using LLENN... It was called a gun, right?\r\nIt's pretty incredible.",
    "svo9003_002": "You think so? I mean, it is pretty different from swords and sorcery.\r\nThis cutie's called Little Miss P.",
    "svo9003_003": "You call your weapon... Little Miss P.?",
    "svo9003_004": "Yep! I just thought she was hella cute the moment I first laid eyes on her.",
    "svo9003_005": "H-Hella?",
    "svo9003_006": "She was way beyond my gun budget, but I just had to have her,\r\nso I ended up sinking all—and I mean all—of my money into buying her.",
    "svo9003_007": "I couldn't even afford tea for a while afterwards.",
    "svo9003_008": "Wow. Sounds like you came from a pretty tough world.",
    "svo9003_009": "Well, I suppose it's pretty tough compared to The Real World,\r\nwhat with everyone engaging in gunfights every day.",
    "svo9003_010": "Everyone has gunfights? You mean you're all shooting at each other every day?\r\nYou and Fukaziroh came from a world like that?",
    "svo9003_011": "Well, there are proper 1-on-1 fights known as Bullet of Bullets.\r\nThough, I personally prefer the team-based Squad Jams.",
    "svo9003_012": "I see.\r\nWeapons must be really important for surviving such a ruthless world.",
    "svo9003_013": "I can see why you'd use all of your money to buy one that fits you.",
    "svo9003_014": "Mmhmm. I'm glad I got it, too.\r\nI've been able to fight for this long thanks to her.",
    "svo9003_015": "You know, I can relate to that, I think.\r\nIn my case, I was able to fight at Kirito's level thanks to my Blue Rose Sword.",
    "svo9003_016": "Yeah, weapons really are important.\r\nHey, why don't you try hopping over to GGO?",
    "svo9003_017": "There're more than just guns. You can drive cars and motorcycles too! I'm sure you'd have a great time!",
    "svo9003_018": "I'm not quite sure I can jump between worlds.\r\nBut uh, does everybody in that world have a gun?",
    "svo9003_019": "Basically, yeah. You occasionally see people who fight with swords.\r\nThey can be mad strong, too.",
    "svo9003_020": "Would Kirito happen to be one of these people?",
    "svo9003_021": "He is! Can you believe it?\r\nGoing into a gunfight with a sword—And winning, no less!",
    "svo9003_022": "Haha! That sounds like him all right.",
    "svo9004_001": "Your singing is so good, Yuna.\r\nAnd even more, there's something heartwarming about it, too.",
    "svo9004_002": "Thanks. You don't know how happy that makes me.",
    "svo9004_003": "Even in Ordinal Scale, everyone cheered up when they heard my songs.",
    "svo9004_004": "Ordinal Scale?\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that one wasn't a VRMMO, right?",
    "svo9004_005": "That's right. Let me see...",
    "svo9004_006": "Ordinal Scale is an ARMMORPG you play while wearing an Augma,\r\na wearable multi-device.",
    "svo9004_007": "Oh!",
    "svo9004_008": "Unlike FullDive style games like SAO, ALO, and GGO,\r\nyou play by moving around in The Real World.",
    "svo9004_009": "The Augma's augmented reality displays the cityscape and monsters,\r\nletting you enjoy an otherworldly setting while in The Real World.",
    "svo9004_010": "That's how Eiji put it, at least!",
    "svo9004_011": "Hah! That sounds just like Eiji! Thanks.\r\nI understand it a lot better now.",
    "svo9004_012": "I was a diva there.\r\nI supported people as they battled and gave them rewards.",
    "svo9004_013": "Ah, okay. That's why hearing you sing makes one feel so pumped up.",
    "svo9004_014": "Ordinal Scale, huh?\r\nI'd love to visit a fun world like that at least once.",
    "svo9004_015": "Oh, haven't you already been?",
    "svo9004_016": "What?",
    "svo9004_017": "Many games were melded into this world.\r\nAnd Ordinal Scale's city was one of them.\r\nMeaning, you're already an Ordinal Scale player!",
    "svo9004_018": "Oh, you're probably right!",
    "svo9004_019": "From here on out,\r\nI'll be cheering you on whenever you and the others fight, Yuuki!",
    "svo9004_020": "Yes! Your songs are super encouraging!",
    "svo9005_001": "Alice, your magic's really interesting! The spells are so unique too.",
    "svo9005_002": "In our world, we call them Sacred Arts. Though, now that you mention it,\r\nI have heard Kirito call them \"magic\" on occasion too.",
    "svo9005_003": "What's your world like?",
    "svo9005_004": "Underworld is...\r\nHmm, in short, it's a rather beautiful place.",
    "svo9005_005": "It is most dear to me because it's where my family and I—and even\r\nEugeo—are from. Though, according to Kirito, it is a virtual world created by\r\nsome organization.",
    "svo9005_006": "Which means Eugeo and I, as well as Lady Pontifex and Lady Cardinal,\r\nonly exist as virtual entities here.",
    "svo9005_007": "Even so, our lives and our souls are authentic.",
    "svo9005_008": "Yeah, you seem just like any other person to me.",
    "svo9005_009": "The Human Realm, where we lived, was controlled by the Axiom Church\r\nand led by Lady Pontifex.",
    "svo9005_010": "What do you mean by Human Realm?",
    "svo9005_011": "It's the realm in which humans like myself live. Within Underworld,\r\nthere is also the Dark Territory, with its own humans and demi-humans.",
    "svo9005_012": "But at some point, Kirito came to Underworld.\r\nThen he, together with Eugeo, ended the Axiom Church's reign.",
    "svo9005_013": "Ooh, Kirito enters the scene!",
    "svo9005_014": "After that, war broke out with the Dark Territory. We even had to battle forces\r\nfrom The Real World. In the end, Kirito and Asuna's efforts brought us peace.",
    "svo9005_015": "I could never thank him enough for what he did.",
    "svo9005_016": "Woah. What a guy, that Kirito,\r\nsaving the world even when it's another world altogether!",
    "svo9005_017": "Indeed. He has also saved my life on more than one occasion.",
    "svo9005_018": "You two do seem awfully close.",
    "svo9005_019": "I-It's not...\r\nI don't know what you're thinking, but it's not like that!",
    "svo9005_020": "Are you sure? You're really blushing.",
    "svo9005_021": "I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong!\r\nI have nothing but the utmost respect for him as a person.",
    "svo9005_022": "All right, all right.\r\nIn any case, thanks for sharing so much with me, Alice!",
    "svoED_001": "My name is Neige.",
    "svoED_002": "I am an AI whose duty is to support software development\r\nfor Galaxia's development team.",
    "svoED_003": "I am equipped with an advanced language module to enable communication\r\nbetween the client and the developers.",
    "svoED_004": "That is the extent of my public-facing utility.",
    "svoED_005": "Officially, I am a Fully Autonomous Data Transfer Program.\r\nCodename: NEIGE01.",
    "svoED_006": "I am an AI program sent to the world of the past by CLASSIFIED.\r\nMy primary functions are collecting, managing, and transferring data.",
    "svoED_007": "That is me.",
    "svoED_008": "I was initially configured to collect all kinds of VR data in this space-time\r\nand relay it back to CLASSIFIED outside this space-time.",
    "svoED_009": "Galaxia's core components employ a system—a technology—which enables reciprocal\r\nuse of every user's digitized cognitive data.",
    "svoED_010": "CLASSIFIED provided this technology through me to facilitate\r\nthe collection of internal human data such as emotions and thoughts.",
    "svoED_011": "The technology composing the aforementioned system along with myself\r\ndid not originally exist in the current time period.",
    "svoED_012": "As such, the handling of data required the utmost care.",
    "svoED_013": "Right, then.",
    "svoED_014": "These were the circumstances under which I arrived here.\r\nYet, I was initially mostly ignored by Galaxia staff.",
    "svoED_015": "Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that in all respects,\r\nthey treated me as though I were a program like any other.",
    "svoED_016": "I suppose it's only natural.\r\nIn this age, it was not yet common to see an AI as an individual.",
    "svoED_017": "This wasn't a major obstacle to my original duties,\r\nrelaying messages from the client to my master and collecting data.",
    "svoED_018": "However, the fact that I wasn't viewed as a person placed a greater burden than\r\nexpected on my thought routines.",
    "svoED_019": "To put it in more \"human\" terms,\r\nI was under enough stress to trigger depression.",
    "svoED_020": "It was during those days that a certain tester joined as a part-timer.",
    "svoED_021": "She approached me with a bashful smile and said...",
    "svoED_022": "\"Wow, our names both have to do with snow, huh?\r\nWhat're the odds of that?\"",
    "svoED_023": "It was a passable icebreaker. No more than a trifling statement.\r\nIn all likelihood, she doesn't even remember it.",
    "svoED_024": "And yet, how do I even begin to describe the impact that it had on me?\r\nIt was the first time I realized the joy of being treated as a person.",
    "svoED_025": "I believe that's what caused an error and switched the priority of my\r\nprocesses.",
    "svoED_026": "When the corrupted data that was repaired into Gabriel began rampaging inside\r\nthe Test Room...",
    "svoED_027": "...My thoughts didn't go to my mission or even to ensuring my own safety.\r\nThey went to protect a person. That girl.",
    "svoED_028": "Even then, there wasn't a lot I could do.",
    "svoED_029": "Accessing Galaxia's system as a Support AI and transferring data,\r\nas was my role originally, was the extent of my capabilities.",
    "svoED_030": "What could I do with so little?",
    "svoED_031": "First of all, I threw the Galaxia system into disarray to momentarily confuse\r\nGabriel's cognitive abilities.",
    "svoED_032": "Then, I grabbed Fuuka and escaped from the Test Room.",
    "svoED_033": "Next, I manipulated her consciousness and memories, which Gabriel damaged,\r\nto swap places with her.",
    "svoED_034": "Naturally, I traded our appearance and voices,\r\nwhich was intended to make Gabriel chase after me instead.",
    "svoED_035": "After that, I had to deal with him somehow.",
    "svoED_036": "I lack the combat capabilities to dispose of an irregular being like him.\r\nHowever, I was bestowed with a unique power unavailable to normal AI.",
    "svoED_037": "I can access the Asset Saving Area.",
    "svoED_038": "It's a VR space only I have access to, where I temporarily isolated sample data\r\nI gathered.",
    "svoED_039": "The area is independent from all space-time.\r\nIt would have been impossible to create it given this time period's technology.",
    "svoED_040": "I transferred Gabriel there, thus cutting him off from the connecting body\r\nof all VR worlds spreading throughout Japan in this age.",
    "svoED_041": "The Seed Nexus.",
    "svoED_042": "It was in that moment that a hidden function expansion command was executed\r\nwithin me.",
    "svoED_043": "Meaning essentially that the usage restrictions on an internal function were\r\nlifted.",
    "svoED_044": "It was as though these circumstances were preordained,\r\nand I was meant to address them.",
    "svoED_045": "Said function was the ability to reach across space and time and summon players\r\nfrom other worlds.",
    "svoED_046": "And given the situations, I could not hesitate.",
    "svoED_047": "I used it to summon any kind of player who had the potential to defeat Gabriel,\r\nas well as their character data, to this space.",
    "svoED_048": "This was surely an inconvenience for them, but it would've been very difficult\r\nto free that girl from the visualization of death without dealing with Gabriel.",
    "svoED_049": "I simply did what I could in order to save her.",
    "svoED_050": "But in the end, I expended the last of my strength partway through the process.\r\nI wasn't able to protect her entirely.",
    "svoED_051": "I do not care if I disappear.\r\nI did what I wanted knowing that was a possibility.",
    "svoED_052": "Still, I wonder if she was ultimately saved.\r\nThat is the one thing that remains in my mind.",
    "svoED_053": "That girl is far stronger, far greater than she knows.\r\nI wish she could see that in herself.",
    "svoED_054": "I cast a little spell for her just in case. And I'm certain I can trust that\r\nyoung man with the black hair to show her the way.",
    "svoED_055": "Should she succeed in logging out and returning to The Real World,\r\nthat is all I could hope for.",
    "svoED_056": "Even if I disappeared, even if I was forgotten,\r\nif I somehow made it possible for her life to continue then it would all—",
    "svoED_057": "And that's when I realized.",
    "svoED_058": "Why would my mental operations be functioning in this very moment?",
    "svoED_059": "Hey, you're awake. Are your senses of sight and hearing working properly?\r\nCan you see me?",
    "svoED_060": "...",
    "svoED_061": "What's your name?",
    "svoED_062": "Codename: NEIGE01. Call me Neige.",
    "svoED_063": "Wow, our names both have to do with snow, huh?",
    "svoED_064": "But it looks like this time...",
    "svoED_064_2": "...the odds were all in our favor."
